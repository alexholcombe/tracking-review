# Serial processing, parallel processing, or both? {#serialOrParallel}

Brains are massively parallel, which has led many to be skeptical that anything has to be done in series, one-by-one. The evidence reviewed above strongly indicates that resources are limited and have to be shifted from object to object for certain tasks, this is compatible with multiple objects being processed at once, in small sets. But evidence emerged some time ago that certain task elements can only be processed by the brain one at a time.

One can certainly walk and chew gum at the same time, and even simultaneously use one hand to rub one's belly and the other to tap one's head, although it may take a bit of practice for some of us. However, when it comes to making a keypress based on the identity of a visual stimulus with one hand and based on the identity of a sound with the other hand, the evidence suggests that one particular component of these two tasks simply cannot be done simultaneously @pashlerDualtaskInterferenceSimple1994. Specifically, the pattern of response times indicates that while a choice is being made in response to the visual stimulus, choice processing for the auditory stimulus cannot commence.

From the beginning of the literature on multiple object tracking, researchers have debated whether any constituent process is limited to one-by-one processing...

Unitary focus of attention in VWM, according to Oberauer, which would help explain the inter-individual correlation with WM performance. 

Hybrid serial-parallel Bello model.
It's possible that tracking greater than the subitizing range requires significant VWM. Franconeri showed you often are wrong about how many targets.
