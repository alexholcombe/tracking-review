# Spatial selection and spatial interference {#spatialInterference}

## Spatial selection of multiple locations

At the beginning of an MOT task, featural attention is typically used to select the target objects, as they are typically highlighted with a different color or by flicker. This does not appear to be not as demanding as the motion phase of tracking tasks [@drewNeuralMeasuresIndividual2008; @franconeriHowManyLocations2007]. However, the selection phase may still be demanding enough to result in incorrect responses on many trials, and thus affect overall performance.

Most importantly for the understanding of the capacity limit on tracking, spatial selection may be more difficult, and result in more errors, when there are more targets. @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 investigated this using two concentric circular arrays of dots centered on fixation. Between one and eight of the dots were briefly highlighted, and then each dot was replaced by either a small horizontal or a small vertical bar. The participants' task was to search for a vertical bar, but the target would only appear in the previously-cued locations. They pressed one key if a vertical bar was present among the cued locations, and another key if none of those locations contained a vertical bar.

In a sparse display with twelve locations, average performance dropped from 98% for two cued locations to 91% for six locations. This decrease is fairly small, suggesting that if the result were to generalize to typical MOT displays, initial target selection would contribute only a small portion of the performance decrease with greater set sizes. However, MOT studies frequently allow objects to come much closer to each other than the spacing that @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 used in their sparse condition. In the denser conditions tested by @franconeriHowManyLocations2007, performance again started at a very high level for two cued locations, but dropped much more, to 74% correct or less for six cued locations.

The initial selection demands in a typical MOT task may be less taxing than in the @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 experiments, because participants need only maintain their attention on the objects, not search through them. However, it remains unclear how much less demanding that is, so we still do not know how much of the target-number effect in typical MOT displays is due to failures at the very beginning of a trial.

For dense displays, one source of error is almost certainly spatial interference, which likely plays a role throughout many tracking tasks.

## Spatial interference

Decades before @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 conducted experiments on the selection of multiple locations with different densities, researchers had recognized the existence of spatial interference in dense displays [@wolfordPerturbationModelLetter1975; @korteUberGestaltauffassungIm1923; @strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014].

If you gaze at the central dot in the above display, you likely will be able to perceive the middle letter to the left fairly easily (it is a 'J'). However, if you again keep your eyes fixed on the central dot, but this time try to perceive the central letter to the right, it should be much more difficult. In the perception literature, this is called "crowding".

Most studies of crowding ask participants to identify a target stimulus, such as a letter, when flanking stimuli are placed at various separations from the target. The separation needed to avoid crowding varies depending on the display spatial arrangement, but on average extends to about half the eccentricity of the target; the interference diminishes rapidly as separation increases beyond that [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970a; @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011]. In the display above, for example, the letters on the same side as the 'J' are separated from it by more than half the 'J's distance from the fixation point, so they have little to no effect on its identification.

When flankers are presented close to a target, they not only prevent identification of the target, they can also prevent the target from being individually selected by attention, which spells trouble for tracking [@intriligatorSpatialResolutionVisual2001].

Crowding of targets can happen frequently in typical MOT displays, so it is not surprising that proximity between targets and distractors are associated with poor performance [e.g., @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008, @tombuAttentionalCostsMultipleobject2008].
The deleterious effects of crowding also show substantial individual differences [@petrovAsymmetriesIdiosyncraticHot2011], such as larger crowding zones in some types of dyslexia [@jooOptimizingTextIndividual2018], so crowding likely also contributes to some of the inter-individual variation in tracking performance.

@franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a claimed that spatial interference is the *only* reason why performance is worse when more targets are to be tracked, denying any role for speed, time, or a general attentional resource. Moreover, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a implied that this interference extends over a much greater distance than the crowding range documented in the psychophysics literature. @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a did not, however, isolate the separation between objects from other variables, and parametric variation of separation has found evidence for tracking interference only within the crowding range [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. Even when objects are spaced as far apart in the visual field as is feasible, tracking task accuracy worsens with target load [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @holcombeCommentCapacityLimits2019].

In experiments with widely-spaced targets and distractors, then, spatial interference is not the principle reason that performance decreases with target load. However, it may be a factor in conventional MOT displays that allow objects to come close to each other. A psychophysical study of crowding with briefly-presented stimuli found good evidence that attending to additional targets within the crowding range of a first target did result in a stronger crowding effect [@mareschalAttentionalModulationCrowding2010]. However, they did not measure how much further crowding extends. More careful study of this phenomenon is sorely needed in the context of MOT. Despite dozens of MOT papers that investigated spatial interference, few have used both fixation and scaling separation with eccentricity such that the relationship of target load and the range of spatial interference could be directly assessed [for a review, see @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did so and compared tracking performance for one targets and two at various separations between the target trajectories. There was a non-significant trend suggesting a greater range of interference in a two-target condition compared to a one-target condition. The effect was small, however, relative to the total additional-target performance cost.
<!-- p.11:"the effect of separation was not significantly greater in the two- target condition than the one-target condition, but the difference did approach significance. Experiment 2: F(1, 7) 1⁄4 3.52, p=0.103. Experiment 3: F(1, 9) 1⁄4 3.89, p=0.054. Such an interaction would be consistent with the proposal that attending to an object results in an inhibitory surround, as attention to the two targets could then inhibit each other. This interaction is small, however, relative to the size of the additional-target cost (see Figure 7), suggesting that crowding is not responsible for much of the additional-target cost."

<!--@maki-marttunenDistinctNeuralMechanisms2019:"In both cohorts, increased load and close encounters (i.e., close spatial proximity) led to reduced accuracy in an additive manner. Load was associated with pupil dilations, whereas close encounters were not. Activity in dorsal attentional areas and frequency of saccades were proportionally larger both with higher levels of load and close encounters. Close encounters recruited additionally ventral attentional areas that may reflect orienting mechanisms. The activity in two brainstem nuclei, ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, showed clearly dissociated patterns. Our results constitute convergent evidence indicating that different mechanisms underlie processing challenges due to load and object spacing."-->

<!--Distractors that pass closer to targets can experience more inhibition (as measured by probes on objects; @doranRoleVisualAttention2010)-->

## Moving forward

The evidence so far suggests that spatial interference plays a role in the resource-intensiveness of tracking, especially in conditions where objects come very close to each other. However, when objects are kept widely separated, it may play little to no role. As will become clear in the next section, however, in such conditions, temporal interference can determine tracking performance.
