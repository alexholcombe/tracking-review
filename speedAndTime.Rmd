# Speed and time

In our list of 

How fast can people track? This is an important question, not only for predicting what people will be able to do in the real world, but also because investigations of the limits on tracking have led to insights into the relation of tracking processes to other aspects of attention and of motion perception.


## Speed


At very low speeds/temporal frequencies, participants have no problem tracking two or even three targets, consistently achieving performance levels above 95% (as seen in Figure 3). This implies that the performance versus resource function is different (shallower) for low speeds. Going from 100% resource (one target) to 50% (two targets) or 33% (three targets) yields little impairment. The reason may be that in this regime of low speeds, even if participants fail to move their tracking focus with the targets for an extended interval (a few hundred milliseconds), they can still recover the targets by finding the objects closest to the positions they last registered. Only at limiting temporal frequen- cies or speeds is there a consequence to having noisy (parallel tracking models, see General discussion) or intermittent (serial tracking models) position updating.

perceived speed is what matters? @marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013

Circular trajectories - explain that it’s the only way to get up to those speeds

## Time

What makes a tracking task hard for a person, or even impossible? 

 tracking task that resembles the shell games used by conjurers to confound audiences. A magician might cover an object with one of three identical shells and shuffle the shells back and forth while the audience tries to keep their attention on the critical shell.
 
Let's return to the classic shell game. In a shell game, an item is placed beneath one of three identical shells, making that shell the target. The viewer tries to keep track of which shell has the item underneath it.

A crucial aspect of the game is that the shells exchange locations with distractors. Thus, remembering the original location of the item is not sufficient. Neither is it sufficient to extrapolate a new position for the target based on the item's first direction of motion. Remembering its relative location in the array (e.g., the "middle one") is also not enough. One really must update one's representation of the target's position, rather than relying on any of the above.

The simple reduced laboratory version of the shell game is illustrated by the following schematic.

The updating of target position could fail for any of a few different reasons. A target might move too quickly for attention to move with it. That is, there may be a speed limit beyond which object position is not appropriately updated. Under serial switching accounts, this speed limit might occur if between successive samples, the object moved further than a critical distance between samples. Under parallel theories, the tracking process may simply have a speed limit. If the speed of the tracking process is resource-intensive, this speed limit may be slower when more targets are to be tracked.

## Temporal limits

Another possibility is that tracking has a temporal limit, much like it has a spatial limit. Recall that in section X we described evidence that if a target comes too close to another object, the two objects can get confused. They won't always be confused, because predictable trajectories and target velocity can be used to recover a target even after it completely overlaps with another (@howeMotionInformationSometimes2012; Vul under review at JoV).

So, spatial confusions contribute to tracking. Might this also be the case for temporal confusions?  There is already reason to think that

Clearly there are some visual processes that are disrupted if other stimuli soon occupy the former location of an object. Perception of the object's color itself is still ok (Nishida ; @cavanaghMobileComputationSpatiotemporal2008). But 

Spatiotemporal window account. 
wapping errors presumably come about be- cause a target and a distractor approach within the width of the attentional window.


One might lose the target because it simply moves too fast to track. Or one could lose it because it came so close to a distractor in peripheral vision that they could not be spatially discriminated. These possibilities of a speed limit and of spatial interference have been well-appreciated by researchers. A third possibility has been less appreciated: a temporal limit.

While temporal limits are less familiar, they are the chief limitation on the perception of motion. The easiest way to understand them is with flicker...

 When someone loses one of multiple moving targets in a crowd, what caused the error?

It turns out that the ability to track is limited by all three kinds of limits: speed limits, spatial limits, and temporal frequency limits.

Because with more targets, these limits overlap a lot, it's still an open question whether speed limits go down just as temporal limits do..


@roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017 found age and gender effects. I think I emailed with her, too.

Bello et al. predict we won’t observe temporal frequency limits if we don’t use predictable circular trajectories. My oscillating spiral display might disprove that very quickly.

## Discarded 

But what about the role of distractor suppression?

A little bit of motion by


A particular pattern of motion may be key.

The direction of motion of the object changes from time to time, and one must continually update the item's position to know in which of the three locations it ends up.

The limits on tracking are not as simple as a speed limit like we have on the highway. To understand why, we need to start from first principles. In particular we need to consider when attentional tracking is actually needed to do well in a task. If one's target for attention moves only a little bit, tracking probably won't be needed.

When is attentional tracking actually needed to perform well in a tracking task? Motion of the target may not be enough. If  targets do not come close to other objects, then one may only need to remember their original location and direction of motion to quickly find them again.
