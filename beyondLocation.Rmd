# Velocity and extrapolation {#beyondLocation} 

Covert tracking keeps one up to date with where objects of interest are. And knowing the locations of those objects has further benefits. In particular, location, together with color and a few other features used by "feature attention", is the main route by which top-down attentional selection occurs. But what benefits does attentional selection provide that are not already delivered by the selection associated with tracking?

Recall that in section X we described evidence that if a target comes too close to another object, the two objects can get confused. They won't always be confused, because predictable trajectories and target velocity can be used to recover a target even after it completely overlaps with another (@howeMotionInformationSometimes2012) In elegant experiments, @wangRoleKinematicProperties2021 created displays

When one needs to know more information about the objects,

one wants to scrutinize the objects further

How well are other features besides position tracked? 

howardTrackingChangingFeatures2008 investigated tracking of spatial frequency and of orientation as well as of position.
Tracking the orientation of an object might conceivably be accomplished by tracking one end of the object, but @scholl showed that we are very poor at doing that.

One concern with this conclusion was that the results might be explained by a bottleneck on the number of spatial locations that participants needed to process rather than the number of locations. However, subsequent work was more effective at spatially overlapping two objects, which diminished this concern [@blaserTrackingObjectFeaturespace2000]. 

## Velocity and extrapolation, not just position

@tripathyMultipleTrajectoryTracking2012 says people use trajectory information in tracking. He shows a severe capacity limit however for detecting a trajectory change.

Extrapolation theory predicts 

* attention will be right on the target.
* Linear effect of velocity

Luu and Howe’s results. There were three key findings:
􏰐 Mean tracking accuracy was higher with predict- able motion.
􏰐 Predictable motion increased accuracy more for two targets than for four targets.
􏰐 The improvement in accuracy was statistically significant for two targets but not for four targets.

Atsma, J., Koning, A., & van Lier, R. (2012). Multiple object tracking: Anticipatory attention doesn’t “bounce.” Journal of Vision, 12(13), 1–1. Found anticipatory attention in the direction of the object movement. Only tested 3 targets and 1 target. Didn’t test the backward direction I don’t think to see whether that was even better!!!



perceived speed is what matters? @marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013

Howard et al. (2011) provided an exhaustive review.  Eye movements lag -  Lukavsky & Dechterenko (2016)

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 @howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 both found evidence that motion is used for one or two targets but not more

Lack of extrapolation:

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 found it for one and two targets but not more

@howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011 included a review of the literature on keeping up with current position.  Eye movements lag -  @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016

What about updating of features? Well, updating of surface features seems to generally be crap, e.g. identity tracking is crap, Pailian
