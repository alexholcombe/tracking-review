# Beyond location {#beyondLocation} 


How well are other features besides position tracked?

## Velocity and extrapolation, not just position

The role of motion signals . Seiffert

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 @howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 both found evidence that motion is used for one or two targets but not more

Lack of extrapolation:

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 found it for one and two targets but not more

@howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011 included a review of the literature on keeping up with current position.  Eye movements lag -  @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016

Ryo Nakayama attention inertia theory

What about updating of features? Well, updating of surface features seems to generally be crap, e.g. identity tracking is crap, Pailian
