# Beyond location {#beyondLocation} 


How well are other features besides position tracked?

Blaser Pylyshyn Holcombe

## Velocity and extrapolation, not just position

The role of motion signals . Seiffert

Extrapolation theory predicts 

* attention will be right on the target.
* Linear effect of velocity

Atsma, J., Koning, A., & van Lier, R. (2012). Multiple object tracking: Anticipatory attention doesn’t “bounce.” Journal of Vision, 12(13), 1–1. Found anticipatory attention in the direction of the object movement. Only tested 3 targets and 1 target. Didn’t test the backward direction I don’t think to see whether that was even better!!!

Howard et al. (2011) provided an exhaustive review.  Eye movements lag -  Lukavsky & Dechterenko (2016)

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 @howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 both found evidence that motion is used for one or two targets but not more

Lack of extrapolation:

@fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 found it for one and two targets but not more

@howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011 included a review of the literature on keeping up with current position.  Eye movements lag -  @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016

Ryo Nakayama attention inertia theory

What about updating of features? Well, updating of surface features seems to generally be crap, e.g. identity tracking is crap, Pailian
