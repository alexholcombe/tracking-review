# Abilities, individual differences, dual-task interference {#abilities}

There are two basic approaches to understanding the abilities that underlie multiple object tracking. One is the classic experimental approach of dissociating the processes involved by manipulating different factors within participants. This has been the dominant approach and has led to our present understanding of the roles of spatial interference, temporal interference, and the duration that one can sustain attention. However, a small but growing literature has used the complementary individual-differences approach. In the individual-differences approach, the pattern of variation in scores on multiple tests is examined to see which abilities tend to go together. Those abilities that co-vary the most are thought to likely share more processes in common than those that don't.

## Do people vary much in how many objects they can track?

@meyerhoffDistractorLocationsInfluence2015b tested fifty participants and for each one calculated the effective number of items tracked, for a display with four targets and four distractors, the modal effective number of items tracked was around two, but a substantial proportion of participants's came in at three targets or one target, and a few scored close to zero effective items tracked. 

Unfortunately, in the data of @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020, like that of many others, there is no way to know how much of the variation between individuals is due to motivation rather than ability. Measuring motivation is not easy, but researchers should at least include what are sometimes called attention checks or catch trials to allow exclusion of participants who show clear evidence of not reading the instructions carefully or frequently not paying attention.


For some cognitive tasks, individual differences are small, making an individual-differences approach problematic [@hedgeReliabilityParadoxWhy2018]. @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 made the effort to test 201 participants on MOT, in an effort to examine variation in how many objects people can track with reasonable accuracy. They found what appeared to be a substantial variation in capacity, with some people able to track six objects, while many could track only two or even just one. However, no analyses were reported regarding the reliability of the MOT test. This left open the possibility that the tracking scores were very noisy, such that the variation in scores found between participants could also have been found if just one participant were tested repeatedly.

<!--One way to have assessed reliability would have been to test each participant two times, to exmaine whether individuals would achieve similar scores in the two instances. For any given test, it is possible that a test is instead very noisy, such that at an extreme the variation in scores found between participants would also be found if just one participant were tested repeatedly.  MOT, visuospatial short-term memory, verbal working memory, and attention switching, and calculated the correlation of performance for each pair of tasks.  For what it's worth, th-->

Although they did not vary the number of targets participants had to track, @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, and @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 all tested a large number of participants and calculated the correlation in participants' performance between one half of the trials they were tested in and the other. All three found a high correlation of >0.85.  Together with their other results and those of @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, this indicates that people do vary substantially in their multiple object tracking ability.

@wilbiksIndividualDifferencesMultiple2020 I haven't read this one but do they account for lapse rate?

Ageing is likely a major source of individual differences, as older participants perform much worse than younger participants [@trickAgerelatedDifferencesMultipleobject2005; @sekulerAgerelatedChangesAttentional2008; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017]. Using a task requiring participants to detect which of multiple objects had changed its trajectory, @kennedyEarlyAgerelatedDecline2009 found a steep decline between 30 and 60 years, where the effective numbers of tracked trajectories during MTT dropped by about 20% with each decade of aging, which could not be explained by a drop in visual acuity. 


Variation in MOT performance is typically interpreted by researchers as variation simply in how many objects a person can track. 

But the underlying reason for variation in MOT performance may not be due to variation in number of FINSTs or some other such capacity, but rather due to variation in peoples' tracking speed limit, spatial interference, or temporal interference. This does not seem to have been properly investigated.


## What tasks are most related to MOT? 

 Large differences have been found in spatial crowding, which probably explains some variance. 
The deleterious effects of crowding also show substantial individual differences [@petrovAsymmetriesIdiosyncraticHot2011], such as larger crowding zones in some types of dyslexia [@jooOptimizingTextIndividual2018], so crowding likely also contributes to some of the inter-individual variation in tracking performance.

Partly to reveal what other sorts of tasks a high ability to track multiple objects indicates, @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 and @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 tested large numbers of participants on several tasks. @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 used a set of cognitive and attentional tasks that he termed conjunction search, configuration search, counting, feature access, spatial pattern, response selection, visual short-term memory, change blindness, Raven's test of intelligence, visual marking, attentional capture, consonance-driven orienting, inhibition of return, task switching, mental rotation, and Stroop. While many of these showed high reliability of over .9, the correlations with MOT were moderate, with the highest being counting at 0.4, which required counting the number of white dots in a brief (400 ms) display. Change blindness, feature access, visual working memory, and visual marking were runner ups with correlations of around 0.3.
<!-- @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 "For each variable, reliability was estimated by calculating the split-half (odd-even) correlations and the Spearman-Brown formula was used for adjustment. All of the 17 paradigms met the minimum reliability of 0.7."  So I guess these are not raw correlations he reports from then on -->

@trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 reported data from more than 400 participants tested online, and tested a set of cognitive, attentional, and common neuropsychological tasks: arithmetic word problems, the trial-making task, digit span, digit symbol coding, letter cancellation, spatial span, approximate number sense, flanker interference, gradual onset continuous performance, spatial configuration visual search, and visual working memory as well as MOT. MOT had among the highest reliabilities, at 0.92. MOT performance had  little correlation with performance on the task designed to measure sustained attention over an extended period (about five minutes, the gradual-onset continual performance task, [@fortenbaughSustainedAttentionLife2015]. This supports the tentative conclusion, already suggested in the "Duration that one can sustain attention" section of this Element, that the ability to sustain attention without lapses is not an important determinant of tracking performance (as was ).

The tasks with the highest correlations with MOT in the data of @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 were visual working memory, spatial span, letter cancellation, and digit symbol coding, all at around 0.5. As the authors pointed out, the letter cancellation and digit symbol coding tasks are complex tasks from neuropsychology that are believed to reflect a number of abilities. This makes it hard to interpret their correlation with MOT. Spatial span and visual working memory are quite different from MOT, but similar to each other in that they both involve short-term memory for multiple visual stimuli.

In the @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 inventory, the task that most resembled the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012, which @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 found had a high correlation with MOT, was the approximate number sense task, with a moderate correlation of 0.3. It differed from the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 by not testing the subitizing (less than 5 items) range, which might help explain any discrepancy. In a more limited study, @eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018 found, using hierarchical regression, that subitizing made a contribution to predicting MOT performance that was somewhat separate to that of an estimation task using larger set sizes. <!-- change blindness, load-induced blindness and multiple object tracking, MOT split-half reliability of .87 -->

Overall, there is a reasonable level of agreement across these individual-differences studies, as well as others not described here, such as @trickSpatialVisuospatialWorking2012. They agree that visual working memory has a robust correlation with MOT performance, which is particularly interesting because superficially, MOT imposes little to no memory demand. Most researchers conceive of tracking as involving allocating multifocal attention to multiple targets simultaneously, with a process autonomous to memory causing the foci of attention to move along with the moving targets. 

"Working memory is a well-established predictor of individual differences in a range of attention tasks, including for example the Stroop task, spatial cuing and task switching (e.g. Kane & Engle, 2001; Kane, Bleckley, Conway & Engle, 2001; Redick & Engle, 2006)."

<!--In Huang et al.’s study, the correlation between MOT and VWM was .30, the correlation between (configuration) search and MOT was .30, and the correlation between search and VWM was .23. In our data, however, MOT and VWM were much more closely correlated with each other (.51)-->

 With the growth of online testing, we can expect this approach to  

## Dual-task

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

The dual-task literature is very large. Can't review it all here

Alvarez, G.A., et al., Are mutielement visual tracking and visual search mutually exclusive? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2005. 31(4): p. 643-667.

There seems to be an especially close link between MOT and subitizing
@trickAgeDifferencesEnumerating2003 observed that even very slow motion reduced
enumeration speed for stimuli containing 6–9 items, while
the enumeration of 1–4 items was not affected when items
were in motion. Similarly, @alstonSubitizationAttentionalEngagement2004
presented static and moving items, finding that faster and
more accurate enumeration occurred in the subitizing range
given the presence of moving items.

Subitizing no bilateral advantage on accuracy, but that could be due to very high accuracy - when looking at response time, an advantage is found, although not clear it's as large as that for MOT @railoBilateralTwoitemAdvantage2014

"The results indicated that the number of items participants could subitize decreased by one for each item they tracked." @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011

 "concurrent performance of a MOT task and a VWM task still instilled substantial and load-dependent dual-task costs. " @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006

psilocybin seems to impair MOT but not visual working memory [@carterUsingPsilocybinInvestigate2005] 

object tracking in people with Williams Syndrome remains at the level of 4‐year‐olds, whereas the ability to remember multiple locations of static objects develops further. @ohearnDevelopmentalProfilesMultiple2010 


@howardVisualSpatialAttention2020 "for a purely spatial task, perceptual attention (TRACKING?) and working memory appear to recruit separate core capacity-limited processes."

@souzaContributionsVisualCentral2017 argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources." "Distracting visual attention, but not central attention, impaired MOT performance"
