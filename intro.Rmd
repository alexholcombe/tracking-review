Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.
How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?-->

Attention is "the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." At least, that is how William James described it [@jamesPrinciplesPsychologyVol1890]. James' description seems to imply that attention has a limited capacity of just one object or train of thought. James was joined at Harvard in 1892 by Hugo Münsterberg, who used moving stimuli to study attention. Münsterberg published a book in 1916, **The Photoplay: A Psychological Study**, which described his theory of the "moving pictures" (the cinema) and included a chapter on attention. 

```{r complication, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="This 'complication apparatus' from the Harvard laboratory of Hugo Münsterberg was used to measure the effect of attention to one stimulus on responses to another.  A subject who focused on one of the numbers on the large dial was found to have a delayed reaction to the sound of the bell, and vice versa."}

Münsterberg's book is good reading, with insights such as that movement attracts attention, but he did not address how attention operates in the presence of multiple moving stimuli. Much later, after World War II, the study of attention grew rapidly, and tachistoscopes became the standard laboratory presentation apparatus. These devices were limited in that they could not present motion - they were designed to present static stimuli very briefly. The dominance of stationary stimuli in the study of attention continued through the 1980s, even as the study motion grew in a separate community of perception researchers.

The first popular home game system, the Atari, introduced the game Space Invaders in 1980 to millions of homes, including those of some of my childhood friends. Asteroids was ported to the Atari soon after, and it became one of my favorites. <!-- (https://youtube.com/embed/YJZ0hB0Vnyk) -->

When one plays Space Invaders or Asteroids, it is frequently the case that multiple objects are moving in the direction of one's avatar. Avoiding a collision seems to require monitoring more than one of these objects at a time. The ability of humans to do this was formally studied first by the Canadian psychologist and engineer Zenon Pylyshyn.

In the 1970s, Zenon Pylyshyn had been pondering the possibility of a primitive visual mechanism capable of "indexing and tracking features or feature-clusters" (he mentions this in @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; I haven't been able to get copies of the 1970s reports that he refers to) as they moved. By 1988, Zenon Pylyshyn and Ron Storm formulated a way to empirically study his hypothesized primitive visual mechanism, and they did a series of experiments on humans' ability to keep track of moving objects [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988]. On their Apple II+ computer, they created a display with ten identical objects moving on random trajectories, connected to a telegraph key with a timer to record response times. Pylyshyn & Storm also pioneered the use of an eyetracker to enforce fixation — in their experiments, movement of the eyes away from fixation terminated a trial. Thus they were able to investigate the ability to covertly (without eye movements) keep track of moving objects. 

In a task that Pylyshyn & Storm dubbed multiple object tracking or MOT, up to five of ten displayed moving objects were designated as targets by flashing at the beginning of the trial. The targets then became identical to the remaining moving objects, the distractors, and moved about randomly. While viewing the display, people report having the experience of being aware, seemingly continually, of which objects are the targets and how they are moving about. In [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAQM4QJRYV8) embedded below, one is first asked to track a single target to become familiar with the task, and then subsequently four targets are indicated.

In addition to their demonstration that people could do the basic task, which in itself is quite important,  @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 also showed that people are limited in *how many* targets they can faithfully track. In their experiments, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 periodically flashed one of the moving objects, and if that object was a target, the participant was to press the telegraph key. On trials with more targets, errors were much more common — while only 2% of target flashes were missed when only one of the ten objects was a target, 14% of target flashes missed when five of the objects were targets. 

The notion of keeping track of moving objects is familiar from certain situations in everyday life. If you've ever been responsible for more than one child while at a beach or a park, you know the feeling of continuously monitoring the locations of multiple moving objects. If you've ever played a team sport, you may recall the feeling of monitoring the positions of multiple opponents at the same time, perhaps the player with the ball and also a player they might pass the ball to. If you've ever wanted to speak to someone at a conference, you may know the feeling of monitoring the position and posture of that person relative to others they are chatting with, in order to best time your approach.

<!-- On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles.  At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water.--> 
<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move  and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey)-->.

## What's to come {#summary}

Despite advances in technology, the study of visual cognition continues to be dominated by experiments with stimuli that don't move. As we'll see in Section \@ref(identity), putting objects in motion reveals that updating of their representations is not as effective as one might expect from studies with static stimuli. This suggests that with static objects, one can bring to bear additional processes, perhaps cognitive processes (Section \@ref(Cequals1)), that motion helps to dissociate from lower-level tracking processes. It is these sorts of unique insights from multiple object tracking experiments that I have chosen to emphasize in this Element, together with the findings that I believe most constrain theories of how mental tracking processes work. I will argue that the five most important findings in the multiple object tracking literature are:

<!--I wrote this book to dispel misconceptions about the nature of tracking processes, lay out the concepts needed to understand the implications of empirical findings, and to highlight the findings with the most profound implications.--> 
 <!--Reviewing the evidence of this vast literature has highlighted four robust findings which I believe to be the most informative about the nature of the underlying processing.-->

1. The number of moving objects humans can track is limited, but not to a particular number such as four or five. (Section \@ref(biggestMyth))<!--[Section 3](#biggestMyth)-->
1. The number of targets has little effect on spatial interference, whereas it greatly increases temporal interference (Section \@ref(spatialInterference)).
1. Predictability of movement paths benefits tracking only for one or two targets, not for more (Section \@ref(Cequals1)).
1. Tracking capacity is hemifield specific: capacity nearly doubles when targets are presented in different hemifields (Section \@ref(twoBrains)).
1. When tracking multiple targets, people often don't know which target is which, and updating of non-location features is poor (Section \@ref(identity)).

The organization of this Element was influenced by my desire to dispel common misconceptions about results in the literature, and to lay out the concepts needed to understand the implications of the empirical findings. In the final section (\@ref(recommendations)) I describe some broad lessons, including how best to study tracking in the future. <!--In that section I also list some of the topics that had to be left out and where to learn more.--> We will start with the concept of limited capacity and bottlenecks in the brain.
<!--

Getting to these findings requires explaining various things

To get to these findings in context, I have organized this book into the following chapters:

* Understanding bottlenecks, resources, and capacity 
* The biggest myth of object tracking 
* Data limitations and resource limitations
* Spatial interference
  * say that I think it's largely temporal interference, which is explained in a forthcoming paper
* A complication with understanding the capacity limit - unitary cognition
* Two brains or one
* Grouping / objects
* Knowing where but not what
* Abilities and individual diffs
* Progress and recommendations

<!--Most cognitive psychology researchers have, however, heard a few things about object tracking. But much of what they probably heard is wrong. In this book, we'll bust a few myths about tracking and see that studying it has yielded some unique insights about our limited capacities.-->
<!--
Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.
-->

<!--Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

Without continuous attentional selection, you not only lose your children

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens.

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.
