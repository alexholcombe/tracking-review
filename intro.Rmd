Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?-->

Attention has been a preoccupation of scientific psychology since its modern beginning in the late 19th century. To define attention, William James in 1890 referred to introspective experience, writing that "It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." Implicit in this description is the limited capacity of higher mental operations; James seemed to think their capacity was limited to just one object or train of thought.

Hugo Münsterberg, one of the first "natural philosophers" with an actual laboratory that studied attention, was highly interested in attention and moving stimuli. His 1916 book **The Photoplay: A Psychological Study** described his theory of the cinema, and included a twenty-page chapter on attention. He and others were by then were conducting experiments using custom devices that measured response time and presented auditory and visual stimuli.

Decades later, the study of attention ended up on a path dominated by stimuli that did not move. After World War II, when the study of attention grew rapidly, the tachistoscope became the standard laboratory presentation apparatus. It could present a set of stimuli, drawn on a card, very briefly, but was not designed to create motion. Through the 1980s, very few attention researchers used moving stimuli, even as the study of motion grew rapidly among perception researchers.

Psychology laboratories did not use cutting-edge technology. Already in 1980, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced the game Space Invaders to millions of homes, and by 1981, Asteroids was invented. <!-- (https://youtube.com/embed/YJZ0hB0Vnyk) -->

Playing both Space Invaders and Asteroids meant shooting and dodging approaching objects. Avoiding a collision seemed to require monitoring more than one object at a time. Nothing like this would be studied scientifically, however, until much later.

A few years before all this, Zenon Pylyshyn was already pondering the possibility of a primitive visual mechanism capable of "indexing and tracking features or feature-clusters" (as he put it in @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; I haven't been able to get copies of the 1970s reports that he mentions) as they moved. By the mid 1980s he was programming an Apple II+ computer to study this. Around the same time, the Apple II+ became an exciting addition to my own household, although my only interest was in playing games and learning a bit about how a computer was programmed.

By 1988, Zenon Pylyshyn and Ron Storm had done a series of experiments on humans' ability to keep track of moving objects [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988]. They had programmed the II+ to create a display with ten identical objects moving on random trajectories, connected to a telegraph key with a timer to record response times. They complemented this  with an early eyetracker which enforced fixation —  movement of the eyes away from fixation triggered termination of a trial. Thus they were able to investigate the ability to covertly (without eye movements) keep track of moving objects.

In the experiments they reported, up to five of the ten moving objects were designated as targets by flashing at the beginning of the trial. The targets then became identical to the remaining moving objects, the distractors, and moved about randomly. It is immediately apparent that one can do this. While viewing the display, people report having the experience of being aware, seemingly continually, of which objects are the targets and how they are moving about. In [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAQM4QJRYV8) embedded below, one is first asked to track a single target to become familiar with the task, and then subsequently four targets are indicated, at different speeds.

In addition to their demonstration that people could do the basic task, which in itself is quite important,  @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 also showed that people are limited in how many targets they can faithfully track. In their experiments, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 periodically flashed one of the moving objects, and if that object was a target, the participant was to press the telegraph key. On trials with more targets, errors were much more common — while only 2% of target flashes were missed when only one of the ten objects was a target, 14% of target flashes missed when five of the objects were targets. 

The notion of keeping track of moving objects is familiar from certain situations in everyday life. If you've ever been responsible for more than one child while at a beach or a park, you know the feeling of continuously monitoring the locations of multiple moving objects. If you've ever played a team sport, you may recall the feeling of monitoring the positions of multiple opponents at the same time, perhaps the player with the ball and also a player they might pass the ball to. If you've ever wanted to speak to someone at a scientific conference, you may know the feeling of monitoring the position and posture of that person relative to others they are chatting with, in order to best time your approach.

<!-- On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles.  At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water.--> 
<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move  and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey)-->.

## What's to come {#summary}

Despite technological advances, the study of visual attention continues to be dominated by experiments with stimuli that don't move. As we'll see in Section \@ref(identity), putting objects in motion reveals that updating of object representations is not as effective as one might expect from studies with static stimuli. This suggests that with static objects, one can bring to bear additional processes, perhaps cognitive processes (Section \@ref(Cequals1)), that motion helps to dissociate from lower-level tracking processes.

I wrote this book to dispel misconceptions about the nature of tracking processes, lay out the concepts needed to understand the implications of empirical findings, and to highlight the findings with the most profound implications. I will argue that four such findings are:
 <!--Reviewing the evidence of this vast literature has highlighted four robust findings which I believe to be the most informative about the nature of the underlying processing.-->

1. The number of targets has little effect on spatial interference, whereas it greatly increases temporal interference (Section \@ref(spatialInterference)).
1. Predictability of movement paths benefits tracking only for one or two targets, not for more (Section \@ref(Cequals1)).
1. Tracking capacity is hemifield specific: capacity nearly doubles when targets are presented in different hemifields (Section \@ref(twoBrains)).
1. When tracking multiple targets, people often don't know which target is which, and updating of non-location features is poor (Section \@ref(identity)).

From these findings, in this book's final section (\@ref(recommendations)), I describe some broad lessons, including how best to study tracking in the future. <!--In that section I also list some of the topics that had to be left out and where to learn more.-->
<!--

Getting to these findings requires explaining various things

To get to these findings in context, I have organized this book into the following chapters:

* Understanding bottlenecks, resources, and capacity 
* The biggest myth of object tracking 
* Data limitations and resource limitations
* Spatial interference
  * say that I think it's largely temporal interference, which is explained in a forthcoming paper
* A complication with understanding the capacity limit - unitary cognition
* Two brains or one
* Grouping / objects
* Knowing where but not what
* Abilities and individual diffs
* Progress and recommendations

<!--Most cognitive psychology researchers have, however, heard a few things about object tracking. But much of what they probably heard is wrong. In this book, we'll bust a few myths about tracking and see that studying it has yielded some unique insights about our limited capacities.-->
<!--
Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.
-->

<!--Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

Without continuous attentional selection, you not only lose your children

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens.

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.
