# Preface {-}

Cite this as:

Holcombe, A.O. (to appear). Tracking moving objects. Cambridge University Press.

This book reviews what we know about human multiple object tracking. It will be published by Cambridge University Press in their [Cambridge Element series](https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/elements/elements-in-perception).

You can read this [here on the web](https://tracking.whatanimalssee.com/index.html), as a [PDF file](bookdown-demo.pdf), or as an [e-book](bookdown-demo.epub), which you can import into your Kindle or other e-book reader.  However, the web version is the only one you should rely on - some features (e.g. movies, some kinds of images) may be missing from the other formats.
