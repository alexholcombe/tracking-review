# Preface

This mini-book was written primarily for publication as a Cambridge Element, 

You can read this on the web [here](https://psyc2016.whatanimalssee.com/index.html), as a [PDF file](bookdown-demo.pdf), or as an [e-book](bookdown-demo.epub), which you can import into your Kindle or other e-book reader.
