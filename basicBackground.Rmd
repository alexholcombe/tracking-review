Relation to abilities

Using Factor Analysis to Bridge Neuropsychological and Psychonomic Measures of Attention. TODD HOROWITZ and MELISSA TREVIÑO, National Cancer Institute, XIAOSHU ZHU, Westat, YI YI LU, Harvard Medical School & Brigham and Women’s Hospital, LUKE SCHEUER, Harvard Medical School & McLean Hospital, GRACE HUANG, Westat, LAURA GERMINE, Harvard Medical School & McLean Hospital – Do neuropsychological attention tests measure the same construct as psychonomic attention paradigms? Previous work (Huang et al., 2012) suggested that many paradigms load on a “general attention factor,” a. Adult participants (N=488) completed a 14-item on-line battery (TestMyBrain. org) comprising psychonomic paradigms [Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), Flanker, Visual Change Detection (VCD), Approximate Number Sense (ANS), Visual Search (VS), Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Task (Grad CPT)] and neuropsychological tests [Trail Making Test A & B (TMT), Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), Digit Span Forward and Backward, Letter Cancellation (LC), Spatial Span (SSpan), and Arithmetic]. We did not replicate a. We obtained a five-factor solution: (1) Capacity (MOT, VCD, ANS, SSpan, DSS); (2) Search (VS, TMT, LC); (3) Digit Span; (4) Arithmetic; (5) Sustained attention (GradCPT) Our findings encourage expansion of psychonomic science into the clinic and illustrate the potential
to learn about attention from selected neuropsychological measures. 

" In Huang et al.’s study, the correlation between MOT and VWM was .30, the correlation between (configuration) search and MOT was .30, and the correlation between search and VWM was .23. In our data, however, MOT and VWM were much more closely correlated with each other (.51)"

" several studies have shown dissociations between MOT and spatial working memory (Bettencourt et al., 2011; O. L. Carter et al., 2005; O’Hearn et al., 2010). Furthermore, Trick et al. (2012) showed that visuospatial ability (including Corsi Blocks, a spatial span variant) but not working memory, predicts MOT."

"Souza & Oberauer (2017) argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources."

Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.
