# Basic background


At the beginning of an MOT task, such as Neurotracker, featural attention (to red, in the case of Neurotracker) is used to select the target objects. Selective attention must then be sustained on these objects when they become identical to the distractors, and then tracked as they move. For neurotypical individuals the initial selection process does not appear to be demanding (Drew & Vogel, 2008) â€“  the average capacity limit for selection is higher than that of tracking (Alvarez & Franconeri, 2007). When the number of objects to track is low and their speed slow, participants can track objects for at least ten minutes with little loss (Wolfe et al., 2007). Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance. With featural attention (e.g., attention to color) needed for target acquisition unlikely to be taxed in typical people by Neurotracker, and only needed briefly, featural attention seems unlikely to improve with Neurotracker training.
