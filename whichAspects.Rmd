# Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance? {#whichAspects}

While Pylyshyn theorized that tracking is accomplished by a fixed and discrete set of pointers, the dependence on display characteristics of the number of objects one can track hints that the underlying process may be continuous and flexible rather than determined by a fixed, discrete set. Based on the flexible resource metaphor, a person might be able to apply more resource to particular targets to reduce the deleterious influence of object speed or another factor. There is good evidence for this [e.g. @chenResourceDemandsObject2013], which will be discussed later, but here I would like to explain the resource concept more, and make an important distinction.

To understand why we can track several objects in some circumstances, but only a few in others, we must distinguish between display factors that impose *data* limitations on tracking, and display factors that impose *resource* limitations. <!--We've already covered C=1 processing, grouping, and the nature of the objects themselves, in Chapters \@ref(objects) and \@ref(grouping).-->

The "data" in data limitation refers to sensory data [@normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975]. If a target moving on an unpredictable trajectory moves outside the edge of our visual field, it is the absence of data that prevents it from being tracked. No amount of mental resources can overcome having no data, at least for an unpredictable stimulus. Data limitations may also occur when sensory signals are impoverished, even if not entirely absent. For example, it is a data limitation that prevents tracking when an object travels at such a fast rate that our neurons hardly register it. So, by data here we are referring not to the raw activation pattern of our photoreceptors, but rather the visual signals available after additional preattentive sensory processing.

People with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Thus, some individual differences are almost certainly due to data limitations rather than variation in tracking processes between people. When performance is data-limited, bringing more mental resources to bear provides little to no benefit. The most popular way of investigating this is by varying the number of stimuli one needs to process, as in visual search studies. If the number of stimuli one must evaluate does not affect how well a person can perform a task, this suggests that the task is data-limited rather than resource-limited, because performance is evidently the same regardless of the proportion of the putative resource can be devoted to it. <!-- More reflections on the relation of the resource concept to underlying mechanisms is in Chapter \@ref(spatialInterference). --> 

Resource-limited processing is typically more interesting for those interested in visual attention and the capacity limits on mental processing. If response time or error rate increases with the number of distractors presented in a visual search task, that is classically interpreted as meaning that a resource-limited process is required for success at the task. However, science is hard - an elevation in e.g. error rate can also occur even if there is no resource limitation, if each additional distractor has a non-zero probability of being mistaken for a distractor, yielding more errors with more distractors even if the probability of successfully evaluating each individual stimulus remains unchanged [@palmerAttentionVisualSearch1995]. 

The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on stimulus conditions, and some of these conditions may reflect data limitations rather than a resource limitation. Still, even in ideal conditions it seems clear that the number of objects that can be tracked is much less than the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early visual areas. In other words, there is some sort of resource limitation.

We'd like to know what factors consume the resource. I'll also be using the term "resource-intensive" - if a deleterious stimulus factor is resource-intensive, that means that increasing the amount of resource devoted to the stimulus can compensate for that stimulus factor. One example is speed of the moving targets. An increase in targets' speed can hinder performance, but reducing the number of targets, which provides more resource to the remaining targets, can make up for that. Moreover, if one object moves faster than another, it consumes more resource. The evidence for that is that the addition of a fast-moving target hurts tracking performance for a first target more than does the addition of a slow-moving target 

Speed, then, appears to be resource-intensive. Speed also can result in a data-limitation, at very high speeds, but long before such speeds are reached, speed is resource-intensive.

One should not assume, however, that when one manipulates something about a display, that something is the only thing that changes. Increasing the speed of the objects in a display can also result in more close encounters between targets and distractors, unless one shortens the duration of the trial to equate the total distance the objects travel. Thus, it could be that dealing with spatial interference is what consumes resource, rather than speed.  This brings us to the next chapter, which is all about spatial interference.
