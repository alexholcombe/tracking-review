# Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance? {#whichAspects}

As @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 pointed out, the processes underlying task performance come in two varieties, data-limited and resource-limited. In the context of tracking we are referring to sensory data. If the targets to track go outside our visual field, it is a lack of sensory data that prevents them from being tracked. No amount of mental resources can overcome the absence of signal, hence the term data-limited. This may also be true of cases where sensory signals are not entirely absent, but they are impoverished.

More subtle forms of this can explain some individual differences in task performance. For example, people with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, again due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Depending on the task bringing more mental resources to bear may provide little to no benefit. The classic way this is investigated is by varying the number of stimuli one needs to process. @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 illustrate this with a visual search study by BeckAmbler
, which is most familiar from the study of visual search. If the number of stimuli one must evaluate does not affect how well a person can perform a task, this indicates the task is data-limited rather than resource-limited. Of course, attention does benefit 

tracking ability. For example, people with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, again due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Depending on the task

The other type of task limitation is resource-limited processes. These are more interesting for those interested in visual attention and the capacity limits on mental processing introduced in section \@ref(bottlenecks).


That the number of objects one can track varies greatly with factors like speed is consistent with resource accounts. This 

Every time someone discovers a factor that affects visual search performance, it is worthwhile to ask whether that factor is taxing a resource-limited process or a data-limited process. That is, will increasing the number of targets exacerbate the effect of that factor?

The absence of a hard limit or 


The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on conditions. Still, it is clear that this number is small relative to the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early stages of the visual system. So, what aspect exactly of tracking imposes this limitation?

Explain why the resource intensiveness aspect of tracking is more interesting than other aspects.

Why do people perform more poorly with more targets? By definition, this means that the processes underlying tracking are capacity-limited, but by itself, that description is not very illuminating. Covert tracking is a complex task, and we would like to know which aspect(s) of it exactly are most capacity-limited.

Below is a list of candidate reasons for the factors that impair performance more when there are more targets:
In a typical MOT task, any of the below are candidates for being one of the reasons, or the main reason, that performance declines with number of targets:

1. General cognition (C=1 processes)
1. Concurrent tasks
1. Duration that one can sustain attention
1. Spatial selection of multiple locations (even static ones)
1. Spatial interference
1. Temporal interference
1. Speed limit of attention-following

This section will explain what is meant by each of these factors. The most important of them will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

<!-- Each of these processes could be resource-limited or not resource-limited. That is, some of these effects may be bigger when one is attending to more targets. This helps fractionate tracking into different kinds of constituent processes -->

## General cognition (C=1 processes)

In introducing the concept of a bottleneck or capacity limit in the previous section, I used the example of math problems. Using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through tracking a single object. For purposes of illustration, let us call the processes involved "C=1 processes" to reflect the possibility that some cognitive processes involved have a capacity of only one object.

Oberauer

What makes MOT interesting to many is that we can track more than one target. This implicates the involvement of another, higher-capacity sort of processing. The contribution to MOT of two kinds of processing, with different capacity limits, complicates the interpretation of MOT results. Even when participants are asked to track several targets, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets.

Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C=1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->

## Duration that one can sustain attention

Tracking may be, in part, a test of how long one can sustain attention. There also is some possibility that additional demands on attention (more targets) reducing the average amount of time one can sustain attention without a lapse. The results of @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007, suggest that this need not be the case. In their Experiment 3, participants were required to track four targets for a period of ten minutes. Every 9 seconds or so, one object was highlighted and participants had to indicate whether it was one of the targets. In a no-feedback condition, participants were not told whether their individual responses were correct. In that situation, performance was substantially worse in the last few minutes of the trial than in the first few minutes (78% correct vs. 65% correct). However, in the feedback condition wherein participants were told immediately after each judgment whether they were correct, performance did not appear to decline over time. These results suggest that if participants are adequately motivated by feedback, they have considerable ability to track for several minutes with no appreciable loss. The comparison between the feedback and no-feedback conditions is not perfect as the feedback does provide a cue that can increase performance (when participants get the probe wrong, they can increase subsequent performance somewhat by switching to another target), but this confound does not seem to be able to explain the lack of almost any performance loss in the feedback condition.

The circumstances used by @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 were quite different from a prototypical MOT task, not least because of the extended durations of the trials. Most researchers use trial durations of less than 10 seconds, and it is not clear whether the @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 results would generalize. It seems likely that motivated participants can attend for several seconds before their attention wanes substantially. @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 did find, however, a substantial decrease in performance for trials of 13 s compared to trials of 5 s. With four targets, for example, performance fell from 91% correct to 74% correct, and this decrease was somewhat greater for larger numbers of targets than for fewer targets. Byrne & Holcombe (unpublished data) did not find any significant decrease over a comparable interval, and the explanation for these discrepancies is uncertain, although it may again be related to participants' motivation.

The reason for the reduction in performance with greater time observed by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 may easily be due to another factor rather than an increase in lapses of attention. In the MOT tasks used by all of these researchers, with longer trials there is likely to be more instances of potential spatial interference, temporal interference, and running afoul of any attentional speed limit. Thus, if any of those factors matter, they could explain the decrease in performance with time. However, the @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 does seem to provide a kind of existence proof that lapses of attention need not be the limiting factor. Granting that that may be the case, an additional question is why, if other factors are in operation, there was *no* evidence of a performance decrease over time in @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007? Well, @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 averaged performance over approximately the first third of the ten-minute interval and compared it to the last third. In the feedback condition, it is possible that all the worst possible events (such as close approaches, causing greater spatial interference) had already occurred by the end of the first third, so whatever level of performance participants were left with at that point already reflected their capacity to track through the most difficult events, which they were then able to continue to do until the end of the trial. Over a shorter time range such as that used by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, this may not have been the case.
 
## Spatial selection of multiple locations



## Spatial interference



## Temporal interference

Temporal interference is analogous to spatial interference, just in time rather than in space. Spatial interference refers to a processing impairment when one object comes closer than a certain spatial distance to a second object, at one time. In contrast, temporal interference refers to when an object comes closer than a certain temporal distance of another, at one point in space.

The objects in typical MOT displays often travel over locations formerly occupied by another moving object. That is, after one object passes over a location, another will pass over the same location, some amount of time later. If temporal interference is a factor in object tracking, then if the amount of time that separates the two objects occupying a location is short enough, tracking will be impaired.

If objects are moving fast enough, they are perceived to blur together, because some parts of the visual system integrate over several dozen milliseconds [e.g., @hogbenPerceptualIntegrationPerceptual1974]. A more interesting question is whether temporal interference occurs on a longer timescale, more relevant to the speeds and spacings typically used in MOT tasks.

## Speed limit of attention-following


## Moving forward

Each of these could hinder performance more with more targets. They contribute in an unknown mix to most tracking tasks .
Thus we don't know which is responsible for various results. For example,
