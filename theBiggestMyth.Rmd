# The biggest myth {#biggestMyth}

Some researchers who use object tracking tasks believe that people can only track four or five objects. @doranRoleVisualAttention2010, for example, claim that "the main finding" from the object tracking literature "is that observers can accurately track approximately four objects and that once this limit is exceeded, accuracy declines precipitously." Similarly, writing about the "object tracking system", @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 wrote that "One of the defining properties of this system is that it is limited in capacity to three to four individuals at a time".

This biggest myth about tracking is actually two claims. The first is that there is a constant limit of around four objects. The second is that, regardless of whether the limit varies across circumstances, accuracy declines precipitously [@doranRoleVisualAttention2010] when the limit is reached. We will address this second myth first.

I have examined the references cited by several papers that might reasonably be taken to be claiming a version of either the first or second claims. Typically, researchers do not distinguish between these two claims, instead they make a vague statement that could reasonably be taken to refer to both. Accordingly, I looked for the evidence behind each of the following statements:
"People’s ability to attentively track a number of randomly moving objects among like distractors is limited to four or five items"  <!--cites Pylyshyn Storm 1989--> [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006],  <!-- which cites Scholl's objects paper which makes the claim of 4 FINSTs but backs it up only with STM etc. type studies -->, "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked"  @alvarezHowManyObjects2007, "people typically can track four or five items" @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011 <!--cites Pylyshyn 1989-->, "participants can track about four objects simultaneously" @vanderburgChangesNotDifferences2019 <!-- (see Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005, for a review; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988)-->. In each of these cases, I have checked the evidence provided, or the papers cited, as well as the papers those papers cite. Each paper either provides no relevant evidence, or finds instead only a gradual decrease in performance as number of targets is increased with no discontinuity, nor even a conspicuous inflection point. For example, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 designated between two and six objects as targets, among twelve identical objects in total. After the objects moved around randomly for five seconds, one object was flashed repeatedly and participants hit a key to indicate whether they thought it was one of the targets. The proportion of trials in which participants were wrong increased steadily with target size, from 3% incorrect with two targets, to 16% incorrect with six targets. Note that even with six targets, participants were performing substantially better than would be expected if they could only track one or two and had to guess on the others.

Even @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988, the paper most frequently invoked when a limit of four objects is claimed, found a quite gradual decrease in performance (their Figure 1) as the number of targets was increased from one to five, and five was the most targets that they tested. In their paper, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 do not suggest that there is a hard or precipitous limit, but in 1994, @pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994 did write that it is "possible to track about four randomly moving objects", even though earlier in that paper they contradict this somewhat by writing "at least four". I suspect that some cases of this sort of slide toward backing a consistent and hard limit reflects a desire for a simple story. It may also stem from an unconscious oversimplification of one's own data, as well as the theoretical framing by @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 that tracking was limited by a set of discrete mental pointers.

The other claim of the myth is that the number of objects that can be tracked is consistently about four. This is already problematic from the fact that the decrease in tracking performance with number of targets is quite gradual (the first myth). Still, let's imagine that the claim is that performance falls to a particular level, such as 75% correct, at four targets. Instead of a percent correct criterion, alternatively the criterion could be something like the halfway point from ceiling to chance performance, or the "effective number of items tracked" [@schollWhatVisualObject2001] calculated by applying a formula to percent correct in conjunction.

Several early studies might be reasonably described as finding that a similar number of objects can be tracked before accuracy falls by much. <!-- Alvarez & Franconeri (2007)  "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992). The similarity of these estimates, combined with the frequency with which 4-item limits arise in other attention tasks, suggests the possibility that there is a “magical number 4” in visual attention (Cowan, 2001; Pylyshyn, 1989)."  neither said any such thing, it seems from my reading of those papers, e.g.  Pylyshyn & Storm 1988 only went up to 5 out of 10 and there was gradual decrease in performance all the way through. --> <!-- Papers I have checked for the 4-object claim: Cowan, 2001 claimed it for MOT, citing Pylyshyn et al. 1994, which does say "experiments showing that observers can simultaneously track some three to five identical target items" but then when he describes the studies he doesn't say they show that, even though in the discussion he says "One is that it is possible to track about four randomly moving objects" -->
<!-- In some cases the problem stems from Scholl Pylyshyn Feldman paper that devised the effective tracking capacity measure assuming 100% accuracy for one object and delivering a single number, often 4, for effective number tracked--> However, subsequent work has revealed this to be an artifact of researchers using similar display characteristics. One of the most salient of these is object speed.

@alvarezHowManyObjects2007 used a display of sixteen circles that wandered about the screen, and found that the fewer in number were the targets to track, the faster participants could track them. Conversely, at very high speeds, participants could only track one object with reasonable accuracy.

allowed participants to vary the speed of the objects in the display and they were instructed to set the speed to the maximum at which they 

varied the objects' speed between 

The finding that participants can track at least four objects with reasonable accuracy is restricted to particular object speeds [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012] and spacings [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008; @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. Moreover, it is specific to certain spatial configurations. If targets are distributed 


Research during this century, however, has made it clear that there is no hard limit on the number of objects that people can track. Neither is there, in typical circumstances, a precipitous decline in accuracy, as claimed by @doranRoleVisualAttention2010. 

is no even, in typical circumstances
Instead, 


But the underlying reason for variation in MOT performance may not be due to variation in number of FINSTs or some other such capacity, but rather due to variation in peoples' tracking speed limit, spatial interference, or temporal interference. This does not seem to have been properly investigated.

Some of the spurious claims of a limit for tracking of about four objects seems to stem from wishful thinking by researchers that the capacity limit on various tasks might co-incide. The literature on numerosity perception had long found a discontinuity in performance for estimating the number of collections of more than about four objects [@jevonsPowerNumericalDiscrimination1871; @revkinDoesSubitizingReflect2008]. In the "subitizing range" of four or fewer objects, performance is approximately as good for rapidly counting four objects as it is for two or one. This appears to have motivated researchers to suggest, sometimes with little evidence, that other tasks show the same phenomenon of a very high performance below a particular number of objects, with a steep decline after. For example, in the Introduction of @bettencourtSharedFilteringProcesses2011, the authors write "both processes [visual short-term memory and MOT] showing an equivalent four-object limit".

Working off the dominant framing, that each person does have a specific number of targets they can track which determines percent correct for each level of number of targets, some MOT researchers report what @schollWhatVisualObject2001 called the "effective number of items tracked". The associated formula, refined by @hullemanMathematicsMultipleObject2005a allows researchers to calculate the effective number of items tracked based on accuracy in an individual condition, given the number of targets and distractors in that condition. This does provide a useful summary of the data, but researchers should take more care to avoid taking it literally.



The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on conditions. Still, it is clear that this number is small relative to the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early stages of the visual system. So, what aspect exactly of tracking imposes this limitation?
