# Unitary cognition (C = 1 processes) {#Cequals1}

Successful performance of a multiple object tracking task may be assisted by two resources. This worries me. One resource is the one that researchers typically believe they are studying. This resource can process multiple targets simultaneously, even if it processes them more poorly than it processes a lone target. This is the resource that most researchers, including myself, use tracking to study. However, the mind also has another resource that likely contributes to tracking performance.

The processes that support our ability to explicitly reason, often referred to as System 2 in cognitive psychology, can assist performance in many tasks. But this system is very limited in capacity - some cognitive researchers think it can only operate on one thing at a time [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002]. This may be what prevents us from doing, for example, more than one 2-digit mental multiplication problem at a time. But this also means one can apply System 2 to tracking a single target, for example to use what you've learned about object trajectories to predict future positions. I will refer to this as a C=1 process because its processing capacity may be only one object.

## An inconvenient possibility
 
<!---This reflects a unitary focus of attention that has an approximate capacity of only one.-->
A lot of the results trumpeted by tracking papers are rendered uninteresting because they could be due to our cognitive abilities operating on a single target, rather than the results speaking to the tracking resource that we can distribute to multiple targets. Many researchers that come out of the experimental psychology tradition content themselves with showing that a factor makes *some* difference to performance, p < 0.05. Never mind *how much* the factor matters. But in a task involving tracking several targets, a factor that has only a small effect could be explained by the unitary C=1 resource working on just one target. As an example of evidence that such processes may contribute to visual cognition, for a multi-colored shape, @xuCapacityVisualFeatures2015 found that participants could only mentally rotate a single part.

Let's say that a paper finds that people track multiple objects more accurately if they move on predictable trajectories than on unpredictable trajectories. I have to think that may simply be due to our central thought processes operating on just one target. Ruling this out requires sophisticated methods, such as showing that the predictable-trajectory advantage applies independently in each hemifield, as we will see in Chapter \@ref(twoBrains), or that the effect shows some other idiosyncrasy of tracking, such as inability to work with individual locations within a moving object, as described in Chapter \@ref(objects).

<!--(as opposed to psychophysics, which is more quantitative) -->
In case you are not entirely clear about my point, another way to put it is that by using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through to success at tracking a single object.

Even when participants are asked to track several targets, then, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets. Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C=1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->
