# Unitary cognition (C = 1 processes) {#Cequals1}

Perhaps tracking benefits from two resources. One can process multiple targets simultaneously, even if it processes them more poorly than it processes a lone target. This is what most researchers are interested in, and what they think their data directly speaks to. However, there may be a second recourse involved.

Some cognitive researchers think that aspects of cognitive processing are unitary and can only operate on one thing at a time [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002]. This may be what limits us to doing only one 2-digit mental multiplication problem at a time. When applied to tracking, it means you can apply your full intelligence and powers of reasoning to tracking that target, for example to use what you've learned about object trajectories to predict future positions. I will refer to this as a C=1 process because its processing capacity may be only object.

## An inconvenient possibility

The possibility that there are two resources that can benefit tracking makes interpreting the results of experiments complicated. It makes a lot of the results trumpeted by tracking papers uninteresting because they could be due to our cognitive abilities operating on a single target, rather than those results speaking to the tracking resource that we can distribute to multiple targets. Many papers that come out of the experimental psychology tradition content themselves with showing that that a factor matters for performance, p < 0.05. Never mind *how much* the factor matters. The p < 0.05 is the only goal. But if the effect is small, its existence could be explained by the unitary C=1 resource. This kind of thinking is a real problem across psychology, and in tracking as elsewhere, it frustrates me. 

As an example, a paper might say that people track multiple objects more accurately with predictable trajectories than with unpredictable trajectories. Well, unless you tell me a lot more, I have to think that may simply be due to our central thought processes operating on just one target. We will describe ways this might be assessed in chapter \@ref(beyondLocation); for now my point is just that this is something to watch out for.

<!--(as opposed to psychophysics, which is more quantitative) -->

If the point remains slightly obscure, another way to put it is that by using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through tracking a single object.

Even when participants are asked to track several targets, then, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets. Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C=1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->
