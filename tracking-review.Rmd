Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?-->

Attention was one of the earliest topics of scientific psychology. By "scientific psychology", I mean the tradition of laboratory studies that arguably began in the late 19th century. In 1890, William James famously provided a definition of attention that began with "It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." At this time, plenty of experiments were being done, using custom apparatus such as devices that measured response time and presented auditory and visual stimuli.

```{r complication, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="A 'complication apparatus' from the Harvard laboratory of Hugo Munsterberg. This instrument was used to measure the effect of attention to one stimulus on responses to another.  A subject who focused on one of the numbers on the large dial would have a delayed reaction to the sound of the bell, and vice versa."}

```

Hugo Münsterberg, one of the first with a laboratory that studied attention, was highly interested in attention and moving stimuli. His 1916 book **The Photoplay: A Psychological Study** described his theory of the cinema, and included a twenty-page chapter on attention.

When psychology and the study of attention grew rapidly following World War II, the study of visual attention was dominated by static stimuli, often stimuli presented briefly with a tachistoscope. Very few researchers used moving objects, and this continued until the 1980s. This was, in part, a technology issue. Scientific laboratories, or psychology laboratories at least, lagged the technology being introduced to arcades and even of homes. In 1979, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced the game Asteroids. <!-- (https://youtube.com/embed/YJZ0hB0Vnyk) -->

Paying the game meant shooting and dodging asteroids that came from all directions. Avoiding a collision seems to require monitoring more than one asteroid at a time. Nothing like this would be studied scientifically, however, until much later.

Psychologists were slow to take up the programming of computers to present stimuli, and even slower to use them to create moving stimuli. In the 1970s, Zenon Pylyshyn was pondering the possibility of a primitive visual mechanism capable of "indexing and tracking features or feature-clusters" (as he put it in @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; I haven't been able to get copies of the 1970s reports that he mentions) as they moved. By the mid 1980s he was programming an Apple II+ computer, when it also became an exciting addition to my own household. I rapidly accumulated a library of games on floppy disks.

@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 announced that they had programmed their Apple II+ to create a display with ten identical objects moving on random trajectories, connected to a telegraph key with a timer to record response times. They also used an early eyetracker, and a movement of the eyes away from fixation triggered termination of a trial. Thus they were able to investigate the ability to covertly, without eye movements, keep track of moving objects.

In the associated experiments, up to five of the ten moving objects were designated as targets by flashing at the beginning of the trial. The targets then became identical to the remaining moving objects, the distractors, and moved about randomly. It is immediately apparent that one can do this. While viewing the display, people report having the experience of being aware, seemingly continually, of which objects are the targets and how they are moving about. In [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAQM4QJRYV8) embedded below, one is first asked to track a single target to become familiar with the task, and then subsequently four targets are indicated, at different speeds.

```{r MOTdemo, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="A demonstration of the multiple object tracking (MOT) task, created by Jiri Lukavsky."}

Aside from the important demonstration that people could do the basic task, the main result of @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 was that the processes that underlie tracking are limited in how many targets they can faithfully track. In their experiments, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 periodically flashed one of the moving objects, and if that object was a target, the participant was to press the telegraph key. On trials with more targets, errors were much more common, from just 2% of target flashes missed when only one of the ten objects was a target, to 14% of target flashes missed when five of the objects were targets. 

The notion of keeping track of moving objects is familiar to many of us from everyday life. If you've ever been responsible for more than one child while at the beach or at the park, you know the feeling of continuously monitoring the locations of multiple moving objects. If you've ever played a team sport, you may know the feeling of monitoring the positions of multiple opponents at the same time, perhaps including a player with the ball and a player they might pass the ball to. If you've ever been to a scientific conference, you may know the feeling of monitoring the position and posture of one researcher relative to a few others they are chatting with, in order to best time your approach.

<!-- On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles.  At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water.--> 
<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move  and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey)-->.

In other books or chapters about visual attention, you won't find much about object tracking. The study of visual attention is still dominated by stimuli that don't move. Most cognitive psychology researchers have, however, heard a few things about object tracking. But much of what they probably heard is wrong. In this book, we'll bust a few myths about tracking and see that studying it has yielded some unique insights about our limited capacities. 

This book is far from a comprehensive review. I originally wrote a much longer book, but had to delete entire chapters to keep this below the word limit. In Chapter \@ref(recommendations) I list some of what's left out and where to learn more.

<!--
Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.
-->

<!--Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

Without continuous attentional selection, you not only lose your children

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens.

<!--
**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.

# Bottlenecks and capacity {#bottlenecks}

Quickly, what is fourteen times eleven? Calculating that in your head would probably take you at least a few seconds. And if I set you two problems rather than just one, for example by asking you to also divide sixty-eight by seventeen, I'm sure you would do those problems one at a time. Indeed, our minds may be completely incapable of doing two such problems simultaneously [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002; @zylberbergBrainRouterCortical2010a].

Such limitations are remarkable given that each of our brains contains more than 80 billion neurons. The problem is not a lack of neurons, really, but how they are arranged - our mental architecture.

Multiplying and dividing two-digit numbers feels like a rather abstract problem, and not something we do each day. So you might think that if we were doing lots of such problems each day, we could do more than one at a time. This is probably wrong - consider that a task we do have daily practice with is reading. Yet despite years of reading dozens if not hundreds of words a day, a large body of evidence suggests that humans can read at most only a few words at a time, and much research further indicates that we can really only read *one* word at a time [@whiteEvidenceSerialProcessing2018; @reichleEncodingMultipleWords2009]. It seems, then, that at least some of the bottlenecks of human information processing are a fixed property of our processing architecture.

To flesh out the way I'm using the word 'bottleneck', consider a standard soft drink bottle. Most of the volume of the soft drink is in the bottom, wider part of the bottle. If you invert the bottle, most of its liquid contents will press down on the  neck. The narrowness of the neck restricts the rate at which the contents can exit the bottle. Similarly, a large volume of signals from sensory cortex ascending the cortical hierarchy would press up against higher areas that are more limited in capacity. The large volume of visual signals is partly a result of the retinotopic organization of the retina and sensory cortex - each has multiple neurons dedicated to each bit of the visual field, all working in parallel. 

The parallel processing happening in sensory cortices gets a number of tasks done, so that higher stages can save the trouble. These tasks include the encoding of motion direction throughout the visual field, as well as color and orientation. A local and regional differencing operation happens for these features, resulting in salience, such that odd features become conspicuous in our visual awareness. In the below display, for example, you should be able to find the blue objects very quickly.

```{r findBlue, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Thanks to featural attention, you should be able to find the blue circles very quickly.", fig.height = 2.0, fig.width=2.5}

pts$x <- pts$x + runif(length(pts$x))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$y <- pts$y + runif(length(pts$y))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$type <- as.character(pts$type)
pts$type[c(1,4,6,8,11,12,13,16,20,25,26,30,33,37,41,44,47,48,52,55,59,60)] <- "distractor2"
pts$type[c(13,26,46)] <- "target"

ggplot(pts,aes(x=x,y=y, color=type)) + geom_point(size=6)  +  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "none")
#+ ylim(ymin,ymax)
```

Orienting mechanisms direct attention to colors or orientations that differ from their surroundings. This is only possible because massively-parallel retinotopic brain areas have orientation- and color-tuned neurons. For other judgments, higher, post-bottleneck brain areas that are very limited in capacity are critical. The visual word form area of in the occipitotemporal sulcus of the left hemisphere needed to recognize words is one example [@whiteParallelSpatialChannels2019]. Being limited in processing capacity to just one stimulus, the word-recognizing process will not recognize a word in a crowded scene until something directs to it the visual signals from a word. We often use the term *selective attention* to refer to this "something" that directs particular visual signals through the bottleneck to limited-capacity processes. <!--Different visual abilities seem to have different capacities, and it is not at all clear that a common selective attention process is responsible for gating all of their inputs.--> If there were no bottlenecks, there would be no need for selection, until the point of action [@allportSelectionActionBehavioral1987].

While word recognition seems to be able to process only one stimulus at a time, other visual judgments may be limited in capacity relative to sensory processing, but have a capacity greater than one. Object tracking seems to be one such ability. Certainly by the coarse performance measures typicaly used, the processing involved in tracking multiple objects seems to be simultaneous, although researchers haven't fully ruled out the possibility that tracking multiple objects happens via a one-by-one process that rapidly switches among the tracked objects.

The existence of very limited-capacity processes illuminates why object tracking is important. By having the location of moving objects of interest in mind, we are able to rapidly deploy all our attentional resources to any one of the objects. This allows more limited-capacity processes to deliver rapid results. <!-- seems to be necessary to, for example, make fine shape discriminations or recognize a word.-->

<!--A major misconception about object tracking has become widespread, and it relates to the nature of tracking's capacity--> limit. <!--See the next section.-->

<!--CROSS-CHECK WITH PSYC2016 TEXT
@duncanSelectiveAttentionOrganization1984 was interested in how many objects we can process at a time. He found that accuracy for making a simple visual judgment about an object was much worse when one needed to simultaneously make a judgment about another. For example, participants were asked to judge whether a briefly-presented rectangle was small or large and also judge whether a simultaneously presented line was dotted or dashed. Performance was worse FOR the two-object condition even in comparison to a single-object condition where two judgments also needed to be made. The participants had to make either two judgments about a single object or one judgment about one object and the second judgment about a different object. To Duncan, his finding that performance was substantially worse in the two-object condition indicated the existence of a bottleneck at a stage that processes objects. He wrote that 

> Findings support a view in which parallel, preattentive processes serve to segment the field into separate objects, followed by a process of focal attention that deals with only one object at a time.

This conclusion was an over-reach. Performance was better than one would expect if only one object were processed, unlike what has been found for word processing. Duncan could explain that by saying that the presentation time was adequate for focal attention to, on *some* trials, process more than one object. Alternatively, however, it may be that the relevant processes *can* handle two objects at a time, but they do so more poorly than for one object. Work that credibly claims that a visual ability is truly limited to one object at a time is hard to find; the reading of words may be an exception.-->

# The biggest myth of object tracking {#biggestMyth}

The issue of how many objects we can track is an important one for understanding tracking's role in natural behavior as well as the performance of laboratory tasks. Unfortunately, some major misconceptions about this have become widespread. As examples, when writing about the "object tracking system", @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 stated that "One of the defining properties of this system is that it is limited in capacity to three to four individuals at a time", and @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006 wrote that "People’s ability to attentively track a number of randomly moving objects among like distractors is limited to four or five items"  <!--cites Pylyshyn Storm 1989-->  <!-- which cites Scholl's objects paper which makes the claim of 4 FINSTs but backs it up only with STM etc. type studies -->. This is a myth, one that is perpetuated by more recent papers with statements like "participants can track about four objects simultaneously" [@vanderburgChangesNotDifferences2019]<!-- (see Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005, for a review; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988)-->

Two claims are often behind these statements, as is evident in the more explicit statements of @doranRoleVisualAttention2010, who wrote that "the main finding" from the object tracking literature "is that observers can accurately track approximately four objects and that once this limit is exceeded, accuracy declines precipitously." The first claim is that there is a constant limit of around four objects, and the second is that accuracy declines precipitously when the limit is reached. The vaguer statements in other papers, such as "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked"  [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007] and "people typically can track four or five items" @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011 <!--cites Pylyshyn 1989--> tend to support both beliefs in the mind of an unsuspecting reader. For each of the quotations in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph, I have checked the evidence provided, and the papers cited, as well as the papers those cited papers cite. Each paper provides no evidence supporting the claim that performance decreases very rapidly once the number of targets is increased above some value. A gradual decrease in performance is seen as number of targets is increased, with no discontinuity; not even a conspicuous inflection point. For example, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, one of the papers sometimes cited in this context, tested from two targets to six targets <!--among twelve identical objects in total-->. After the five-second phase of random motion of the objects, one object was flashed repeatedly and participants hit a key to indicate whether they thought it was one of the targets. The proportion of trials in which participants were wrong increased steadily with target size, from 3% incorrect with two targets, to 16% incorrect with six targets.<!--Note that even with six targets, participants were performing substantially better than would be expected if they could only track one or two and had to guess on the others.-->

@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 may be the paper most frequently invoked when a limit of four objects is claimed. But @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 found a quite gradual decrease in performance (their Figure 1) as the number of targets was increased from one to five, and five was the most targets that they tested. And nowhere did @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 state that there is a value beyond which performance declines rapidly. In 1994, early in a paper @pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994 wrote that people can track "at least four" objects, but later in the paper they made a statement that could be interpreted as suggesting a limit of four objects, writing that it is "possible to track about four randomly moving objects" [@pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994]. I suspect that this sort of slide toward backing a hard limit is caused in part by the desire for a simple story. It may also stem from an unconscious oversimplification of one's own data, as well as the theoretical commitment of Pylyshyn to the idea that tracking is limited by a set of discrete mental pointers.

Recall that this myth is associated with two claims, both that there is a "limit" after which performance decreases rapidly, and  that this limit is consistently found to be about four. Because the published evidence indicates that the first claim is completely false, let's put that aside and consider a soft version of the second claim, one that seems plausible. Specifically, is it the case that tracking performance falls to some particular level, such as 75% correct, at about four targets, even if this does not mark a hard limit or inflection point? And instead of a performance criterion like 75%, one might alternatively use a criterion like the halfway point from ceiling to chance [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013], or the "effective number of items tracked", calculated by applying a formula to percent correct with the number of targets and distractors [@schollWhatVisualObject2001]. Charitably, this may be what @alvarezHowManyObjects2007 meant when they wrote: "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992)", and the early studies they cited are arguably compatible with this statement. <!-- Alvarez & Franconeri (2007)  "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992). The similarity of these estimates, combined with the frequency with which 4-item limits arise in other attention tasks, suggests the possibility that there is a “magical number 4” in visual attention (Cowan, 2001; Pylyshyn, 1989)."  neither said any such thing, it seems from my reading of those papers, e.g.  Pylyshyn & Storm 1988 only went up to 5 out of 10 and there was gradual decrease in performance all the way through. --> <!-- Papers I have checked for the 4-object claim: Cowan, 2001 claimed it for MOT, citing Pylyshyn et al. 1994, which does say "experiments showing that observers can simultaneously track some three to five identical target items" but then when he describes the studies he doesn't say they show that, even though in the discussion he says "One is that it is possible to track about four randomly moving objects" -->
<!-- In some cases the problem stems from Scholl Pylyshyn Feldman paper that devised the effective tracking capacity measure assuming 100% accuracy for one object and delivering a single number, often 4, for effective number tracked--> However, work published over the last fifteen years has revealed this to be an artifact of researchers using similar display and task characteristics. That is, findings that approximately four objects can be tracked based on some performance criterion are arguably just an accident of researchers using similar display parameters. One of the most salient of these parameters is object speed.

The enormous influence of object speed in conventional trackig displays was made clear by @alvarezHowManyObjects2007, who tested participants with a display of sixteen wandering discs. The fewer the number of discs designated as targets, the faster the participants could track each target. In other words, when there were only a few targets, participants could track them even when they moved at high speeds. At very high speeds, participants could track only one object with reasonable accuracy. This indicated that the truth of the idea that participants can track four objects is entirely dependent on the speed of those objects. Additional evidence for this was found by my lab, among others [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @feriaSpeedHasEffect2013]. Soon, a few other display parameters that strongly affect the number of objects that can be tracked were discovered, in particular object spacing [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008; @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. <!--As we will be discussed extensively in section \@ref(twoBrains), one aspect of spacing is that tracking performance can depend greatly on whether the targets are distributed between the left and right hemifields or instead are confined to one hemifield.--> 

In summary, it is incorrect to say that people can track about four moving objects, or even that once some number of targets is reached, performance declines very rapidly with additional targets. The number that can be tracked is quite specific to the display arrangement, object spacing, and object speeds. If a researcher is tempted to write that "people can track about four objects", they should stipulate that this refers to certain tasks, display characteristics, and performance measures<!--something that I have almost never seen in the literature.-->

This same issue of how to characterize a human cognitive limit has long bedeviled the study of short-term memory, a literature in which the most famous papers is arguably "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information" [@millerMagicalNumberSeven1956]. At an international workshop in 2013, two dozen working memory researchers met to develop "benchmarks for models of working memory". One of the issues they grappled with was how to characterize the limit on how many items people can remember. In the paper that came out of the workshop, the researchers pointed out that "observed item limits vary substantially between materials and testing procedures" [@oberauerBenchmarksModelsShortterm2018]. They suggested, however, that much of this variability could be explained by humans' ability to store groups of items as "chunks" and thus the group endorsed a statement that there is a limit of "three to four chunks" [@cowanMagicalNumberShortterm2001a]. In the case of short-term memory, then, the observed variability in experiments' results can potentially be explained by a common underlying limit of three to four chunks that manifests as different observed item limits depending on circumstances (in particular, the opportunity for chunking).

In the case of MOT, it is possible that researchers will be able to identify a set of circumstances that consistently yield a mean tracking limit, in the modal human, of three or four targets, if "limit" is defined as performance falling to a particular level on some performance metric. Probably these circumstances will simply be certain spacings, speeds, object trajectories, and number of objects in a display. It would be nice if some underlying construct, the counterpart of memory's "chunks", would be identified to explain how performance changes when other circumstances are used. That would constitute real progress in theory development. However, I don't see anything like that in the literature currently.

<!-- At this point,  to defend the claim that people can track "about four objects" is to suggest that the studies that have found four targets to be the number that can be tracked . Is there something special about  these speeds. Nobodh justified them with ecological analysis-->

## Different tasks, same limit?

Even with the idea that there is a particular number of objects one can track discarded, there remains a related claim, one common in the literature, that might remain viable. This claim is frequently tangled up in the myth reviewed above, for example it may be stated as the idea that there is a "magical number four". After discarding the attachment to the idea of a number that does not vary with circumstances, the remaining notion is that very different tasks have the same number-of-objects limit when tested in comparable circumstances. For example, @bettencourtSharedFilteringProcesses2011 stated that visual short-term memory and <OT show "an equivalent four-object limit", and @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 similarly claimed that visuo-spatial short-term memory, ultra-rapid counting (subitizing), and multiple object tracking share a common limit of "three or four items".

Perhaps the leading candidate for a hard limit in cognitive psychology is the "subitizing" or near-exact numerosity perception limit mentioned in the previous chapter. Many researchers consider the idea of a sudden decrease in accuracy when the number of objects shown goes from less than four to more than four as well-supported [@revkinDoesSubitizingReflect2008]. Four objects and fewer is frequently referred to as the "subitizing range", with performance approximately as good for rapidly counting four objects as it is for two or one. Note that this is very different than in tracking, for which speed thresholds decline rapidly from one to two targets, as well as to three and four. For visual working memory, which as we mentioned several experts have characterized as being limited to three or four chunks, whether there is a discontinuity after four objects or at any point remains highly debated [e.g. @robinsonThereCapacityAssessing2020].

Overall then, it is doubtful that tasks such as object tracking, visual working memory, and subitizing can be said to have a common limit. Ideally someone would assess this by measuring the limits for all three tasks using the same stimuli, but it is unclear how to equate the information available across tasks. Especially difficult is comparing performance with the briefly-presented static stimuli used in subitizing and working memory tasks to the extended exposures of moving stimuli needed to assess object tracking. A stronger understanding of the processes mediating tracking would be required to model performance of the two tasks using a common framework via which they could be compared at an underlying psychological construct level. However, another approach is to measure the tasks of interest in large numbers of individuals and see whether the different task limits strongly co-vary between individuals. The findings from this approach are reviewed in section \@ref(abilities).

<!--Working off the dominant framing, that each person does have a specific number of targets they can track which determines percent correct for each level of number of targets, some MOT researchers report what @schollWhatVisualObject2001 called the "effective number of items tracked". The associated formula, refined by @hullemanMathematicsMultipleObject2005a allows researchers to calculate the effective number of items tracked based on accuracy in an individual condition, given the number of targets and distractors in that condition. This does provide a useful summary of the data, but researchers should take more care to avoid taking it literally.--> <!--Still, it does seem that the number four pops up more than would be expected if these abilities were unrelated. -->

To summarize this chapter, there are three common misconceptions about what has been shown about object tracking. The one that we have just discussed is that different tasks show the same limit. This may actually be true, but I know of no research that have used the same display and task settings to adequately back this up. In the previous section of this chapter, we saw that it is not justified to say that as the number of targets is increased to about four, performance falls to a certain criterion level. One must specify particular display and task characteristics in order to make that statement true. A final misconception is that performance falls very rapidly when one increases the number of targets past a particular number (the "limit").

Given that tracking performance does depend greatly on circumstances and falls gradually rather than displaying a discontinuity at a particular target number, what are the implications for how tracking works?

<!--chapter:end:theBiggestMyth.Rmd-->

# Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance? {#whichAspects}

Certain brain processes can only operate on a limited number of visual representations. The term "limited resource" is often used for this, because we can choose to some extent, with visual attention, which visual representations are processed. Contrary to what Pylyshyn theorized early on, tracking processes do seem to be utilized like a continuous resource, wherein applying more resource to a target can reduce the deleterious influence of object speed or other factors. I will say more about this in a later chapter, but first want to explain the resource concept more, and make an important distinction.

To understand why we can track several objects in some circumstances, but only a few in others, we must distinguish between display factors that impose data limitations on tracking, and display factors that impose resource limitations. <!--We've already covered C=1 processing, grouping, and the nature of the objects themselves, in Chapters \@ref(objects) and \@ref(grouping).-->

The "data" in data limitation refers to sensory data [@normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975]. If a target moving on an unpredictable trajectory moves outside the edge of our visual field, it is a lack of data that prevents it from being tracked. No amount of mental resources can overcome a dearth of data about an unpredictable stimulus. Data limitations may also occur when sensory signals are impoverished, even if not entirely absent. For example, an object traveling at a rate faster than our neurons can register cannot be tracked due to a data limitation. So, the data being referred to here are not the pattern of light falling on the retina, but rather that light after it has been processed by the retina and after additional preattentive sensory processing.

People with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, again due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Thus, some individual differences are almost certainly due to data limitations rather than variation in tracking processes between people. when performance is data-limited, bringing more mental resources to bear may provide little to no benefit. The classic way that this is investigated is by varying the number of stimuli one needs to process. @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 illustrate this with a visual search study. If the number of stimuli one must evaluate does not affect how well a person can perform a task, this suggests that the task is data-limited rather than resource-limited, because performance is the same regardless of the proportion of the putative resource can be devoted to it. <!-- More reflections on the relation of the resource concept to underlying mechanisms is in Chapter \@ref(spatialInterference). -->

When a process is resource-limited, that typically is more interesting for those interested in visual attention and the capacity limits on mental processing. When response time or error rate increases with the number of distractors presented in a visual search task, that was classically interpreted as meaning that a resource-limited process is required for success at the task. As they say, however, science is hard. An elevation in e.g. error rate will also occur even if there is no resource limitation, but each additional distractor has a non-zero probability of being mistaken for a distractor, then there will be more errors with more distractors even if the probability of successfully evaluating each individual stimulus remains unchanged [@palmerAttentionVisualSearch1995]. 

The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on stimulus conditions, and some of these conditions may reflect data limitations rather than a resource limitation. Still, even in ideal conditions it seems clear that the number of objects that can be tracked is much less than the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early stages of the visual system. There is a resource limitation, and we'd like to know which factors consume the resource. Another way to think of this is with the term that I prefer, "resource-intensive". If a deleterious stimulus factor that worsens performance is resource-intensive, this means that increasing the amount of resource devoted the stimulus can compensate for that stimulus factor.

One example is object speed. An increase in object speed can hinder performance, but reducing the number of targets, which provides more resource to the remaining targets, can make up for that. Speed, then, is resource-intensive (although as we will see in chapter \@ref(speedAndTime), there is more going on with speed than most believe). Of course, speed also can result in a data-limitation, at very high speeds, but long before such speeds are reached, speed is resource-intensive.

<!--When we discover a stimulus factor that affects multiple object tracking performance, it is worthwhile to ask whether that factor is taxing a resource-limited process or a data-limited process. That is, will increasing the number of targets exacerbate the effect of that factor?-->

In summary, to say that tracking is capacity-limited is important but not very illuminating. We want to know more about why people perform more poorly with more targets. Tracking is a complex task, and we would like to know which aspect(s) of it exactly are most capacity-limited, or "resource-intensive".

## Which factors

A top priority among tracking reseachers is understanding the reasons that tracking performance falls with the number of targets to track. Several ideas have been advanced in the literature. Perhaps spreading the tracking resource among more targets results in

* Less frequent sampling of each target.
* More noise in the representation of the spatial location of each target.
* Poorer predictions of where the targets are going, which then hinders tracking.
<!-- * Fewer neurons devoted to solving the correspondence problem. (the correspondence problem will be explained later)-->

Progress on these issues has been slow. One approach in the literature has been computational modeling. Multiple researchers have proposed models, compared their performance on human data, and declared their model a success. Rarely, however, have they quantitatively compared their model to that of another group of researchers, making it difficult to know whose model is best or whether the data simply doesn't strongly favor one model over another.

An approach that I favor is to start with a task analysis with some conjectures regarding what aspects of MOT trajectories might lead to errors, based on what we know about visual processing, and then manipulate the incidence of those aspects to test those conjectures. Once an aspect seems to be isolated (or nearly isolated) by a particular manipulation, one can measure how resource-intensive that aspect's errors are.

Here I will list a few factors that studies suggest are important.

<!--1. Spatial selection of multiple locations (even static ones)-->
1. Spatial interference
1. Temporal interference
1. Object speed <!--limit of attention-following-->
1. Use of motion direction


<!-- Each of these processes could be resource-limited or not resource-limited. That is, some of these effects may be bigger when one is attending to more targets. This helps fractionate tracking into different kinds of constituent processes -->

<!-- 
## Spatial selection of multiple locations

## Spatial interference

## Temporal interference

Temporal interference is analogous to spatial interference, just in time rather than in space. Spatial interference refers to a processing impairment when one object comes closer than a certain spatial distance to a second object, at one time. In contrast, temporal interference refers to when an object comes closer than a certain temporal distance of another, at one point in space.

The objects in typical MOT displays often travel over locations formerly occupied by another moving object. That is, after one object passes over a location, another will pass over the same location, some amount of time later. If temporal interference is a factor in object tracking, then if the amount of time that separates the two objects occupying a location is short enough, tracking will be impaired.

If objects are moving fast enough, they are perceived to blur together, because some parts of the visual system integrate over several dozen milliseconds [e.g., @hogbenPerceptualIntegrationPerceptual1974]. A more interesting question is whether temporal interference occurs on a longer timescale, more relevant to the speeds and spacings typically used in MOT tasks.

## Speed limit of attention-following

-->

In the coming chapters I will explain at length what these factors are. Of particular interest is whether each factor is resource-intensive. The table below provides an oversimplified summary of what I think we know. The degree to which each factor is hemifield specific is also included in the table, because as we will see in Chapter \@ref(twoBrains), knowing that is very important. The literature has not done a good job at determining how resource-intensive some of these factors are, hence some question marks are included in the table. 


```{r table-limits, tidy=F, echo=F}
#Create a table with column indicating how resource-intensive each factor is thought to be and how much of the load effect is borne by a hemisphere-specific effect.
library('tibble')
tt<- tibble(factor=c("spatial interference","temporal interference","speed limit","use of motion direction"),
            `resource intensiveness` = c("low?","high","unknown","C=1 only?"),
            `hemifield specificity` = c("medium","high?","unknown","unknown"),
            `contribution to standard MOT` = c("medium to high","unknown","low?","low"),            
            )
  
knitr::kable(
  tt, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Factors that affect MOT performance'
)
# https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/tables.html
```

By "contribution to standard MOT", the fourth column of the table, I mean the degree to which the factor determines performance in a task with the relatively unconstrained trajectories that most researchers use.

Before going on to address each of these factors, I would also like to address a factor that is somewhat different in kind.

## Duration that one can sustain attention

Tracking may be, in part, a test of how long one can sustain attention. If a participant gets distracted or starts day-dreaming, that participant might completely stop tracking and, when their attention returns, not know the last locations of the targets. Lapses of attention are a problem in most other laboratory tasks as well, of course, but they are often thought to be particularly important for tracking because tracking requires a longer continuous engagement with the stimuli than for other common laboratory tasks. This is because the trials last for several seconds, typically, and the stimuli are continuously moving, so shifting one's attention away from the display can mean losing the targets.

This greater vulnerability to attentional lapses means that tracking may be more affected by motivation than many other tasks involving visual judgments. Introspectively, it does feel that way to me, relative to many perceptual tasks where I feel I only need to attend for the split-second when the stimuli are presented, and the percept I need to report jumps out at me. The possibility that variability in motivation drives a lot of variability in tracking performance is unfortunate, because we don't study tracking because we're interested in motivation.

It is also possible that the ability to continuously sustain attention may be distinct from general motivation and may cause a lot of variation in tracking. Like motivation, this could hinder efforts to get at the mechanisms specific to tracking that are not simply sustained attention. On the other hand, sustained attention and the limited resource that allows one to track a certain number of targets may be linked. That is, having to track more targets may reduce the amount of time that one can sustain attention on the task. Fortunately, the results of @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 suggest that this may not be the case.

In Experiment 3 of @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007, participants were required to track four targets for a period of ten minutes. Every ten seconds or so, one object was highlighted and participants had to indicate whether it was one of the targets. In a no-feedback condition, participants were not told whether their individual responses were correct. In that situation, performance was substantially worse in the last few minutes of the trial than in the first few minutes (78% correct vs. 65% correct). However, in the feedback condition wherein participants were told immediately after each judgment whether they were correct, performance did not appear to decline over time. These results suggest that if participants are adequately motivated by feedback, they have considerable ability to track for several minutes with no appreciable loss. The comparison between the feedback and no-feedback conditions is not perfect as the feedback does provide a cue that can increase performance (when participants get the probe wrong, they can increase subsequent performance somewhat by switching to another target), but this confound does not seem to be able to explain the lack of almost any performance loss in the feedback condition.

The circumstances used by @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 were quite different from a prototypical MOT task, not least because of the extended durations of the trials. Most researchers use trial durations of less than ten seconds, which likely means that a decrease in performance with time due to waning attentino is less of an issue. It seems likely that motivated participants can attend for several seconds before their attention wanes substantially. @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 did find a substantial decrease in performance for trials of 13 s compared to trials of 5 s. With four targets, for example, performance fell from 91% correct to 74% correct, and this decrease was somewhat greater for larger numbers of targets than for fewer targets. Byrne & Holcombe (unpublished data) did not find any significant decrease over a comparable interval, and the explanation for these discrepancies is uncertain, although it may again be related to participants' motivation.

The reason for the reduction in performance with greater time observed by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 may easily be due to another factor rather than an increase in lapses of attention. In the MOT tasks used by all of these researchers, with longer trials there is likely to be more instances of potential spatial interference, temporal interference, and running afoul of any tracking speed limit. Thus, if any of those factors matter, they could explain the decrease in performance with time. However, the @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 does seem to provide a kind of existence proof that lapses of attention need not be the limiting factor. Granting that that may be the case, an additional question is why, if other factors are in operation, there was *no* evidence of a performance decrease over time in @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007? Well, @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 averaged performance over approximately the first third of the ten-minute interval and compared it to the last third. In the feedback condition, it is possible that all the worst possible events (such as close approaches, causing greater spatial interference) had already occurred by the end of the first third, so whatever level of performance participants were left with at that point already reflected their capacity to track through the most difficult events, which they were then able to continue to do until the end of the trial. Over a shorter time range such as that used by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, this may not have been the case.

I know of no studies of what display characteristics make tracking performance more vulnerable to attentional lapses. It stands to reason that if objects are moving very slowly, a lapse may be less detrimental because if after the lapse, one still remembers the last-monitored locations, the targets may still be near them. @fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007 showed that people can reacquire targets after a 300 millisecond disappearance, and @alvarezMultielementVisualTracking2005 showed that people can do this after being interrupted by a second task, although these interruptions are obviously different than an attentional lapse, during which it's not clear how often people forget the target locations.

Vigilance tasks such as the gradual-onset continual performance task are expressly designed to assess sustained attention and lapses over an extended interval, and an individual-differences study by @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 found that MOT performance had little correlation with a five-minute gradual-onset continual performance task. This is somewhat reassuring as it, like some of the other evidence I have mentioned, suggests that lapses are not a major determinant of MOT performance.

# Spatial interference {#spatialInterference}

Details of the world that are much smaller than ourselves, like the fibers of a piece of paper, or the individual blotches laid down on paper by a printer, are inaccessible to the naked eye, largely because our photoreceptors are too widely-spaced. This is a familiar limit on our visual abilities, one that is measured every time we go to the optometrist. Line segments or objects that are too close together are experienced is a single unit.

Critically, even when two objects are spaced far apart enough that they can easily be seen to be two objects rather than one, they are not processed entirely separately by the brain. Receptive fields grow larger and larger as visual signals ascend the visual hierarchy, and this can result in a degraded representation in the visual system for objects that are near each other. In other words, spatial interference ensues.

<!--Decades before @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 conducted experiments on the selection of multiple locations with different densities, researchers had recognized the existence of spatial interference in dense displays-->
A large body of psychophysical work has investigated the display densities that impair object perception. Common tasks in this literature include letter identification and grating orientation discrimination [e.g., @wolfordPerturbationModelLetter1975; @korteUberGestaltauffassungIm1923; @strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "When one gazes at the central dot, the central letter to the left is not crowded, but the central letter to the right is."}

}")
```

In the above display, if you gaze at the central dot, you likely will be able to perceive the middle letter to the left fairly easily as a 'J'. However, if while keeping your eyes fixed on the central dot you instead try to perceive the central letter to the right, the task is much more difficult. This spatial interference phenomenon is called "crowding" in the perception literature.

Most studies of crowding ask participants to identify a target such as a letter when flanking stimuli are placed at various separations from the target. The separation needed to avoid crowding varies depending on the display spatial arrangement, but on average is about half the eccentricity of the target; the interference diminishes rapidly as separation increases beyond that [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970a; @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011]. In the display above, for example, the letters on the same side as the 'J' are separated from it by more than half the 'J's distance from the fixation point, so they have little to no effect on its identification.

When flankers are presented close to a target, they not only prevent identification of the target, they can also prevent the target from being individually selected by attention, which likely spells trouble for multiple object tracking [@intriligatorSpatialResolutionVisual2001]. When a target and distractor are too close to be distinguished by tracking processes, the tracking process may inadvertently end up tracking a distractor rather than the target.

Crowding happens frequently in typical MOT displays, in that in most experiments, objects are not prevented from coming within half the eccentricity of each other. It is not surprising, then, that in typical MOT displays,
greater proximity of targets and distractors is associated with poor performance [@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008; @tombuAttentionalCostsMultipleobject2008].

## Spatial interference does not explain why tracking many targets is more difficult than tracking only a few

<!-- MOVE TO PREFACE TO SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL INTERFERENCE The errors in MOT occur largely when a target and a distractor come close to each other, in space or in time. During a close encounter between a target and a distractor, one may end up tracking the distractor rather than the target.
 @baeCloseEncountersDistracting2012 @drewSwappingDroppingElectrophysiological2012 -->

@franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a claimed that spatial interference is the *only* reason why performance is worse when more targets are to be tracked, denying any role for speed, time, or a resource that is depleted when more targets must be tracked. They posited that tracking errors, other than lapses of concentration, are caused entirely by the poor spatial resolution of tracking's selection process, together with inhibitory surrounds that can cause mutual interference among the selection of nearby targets. The most provocative tenet of their theory was that "there is no limit on the number of trackers, and no limit per se on tracking capacity" (p.920), implying that a very large number of targets could be tracked if they were kept far apart from each other.

In pursuing tests of this theory, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a unfortunately did not isolate the separation between objects from other display variables. More generally in the literature, MOT studies rarely control the retinal separation among the objects in a display. For example, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a kept object trajectories essentially constant in their experiments but varied the total distance traveled by the objects (by varying both speed and trial length), on the basis that if close encounters were the only cause of errors, they should be proportional to the total distance traveled. When they found that performance did decrease with distance traveled, but there was little effect of the different object speeds and trial durations that they used, they took this as strong support for their theory that only spatial proximity mattered.

As @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a wrote in their conclusion, their hypothesis that "barring object-spacing constraints, people could reliably track an unlimited number of objects as fast as they could track a single object" constituted a "simple and falsifiable hypothesis". I believed this hypothesis to be unlikely to be true, and on obvious test was to keep all the objects in an MOT display widely separated, vary the number of targets, and measure the speed threshold in each case.

In 2012, my student Wei-Ying Chen and I conducted several experiments in this vein. In one, we used an ordinary computer screen but had participants bring their noses quite close to it to create a wide-field display, which allowed us to keep targets and distractors dozens of degrees of visual angle from each other @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012. The basic display configuration is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:HC2012BasicTrial).


```{r HC2012BasicTrial, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="In experiments by Holcombe and Chen (2012), after the targets were highlighted in white, all the discs became red and revolved about the fixation point. During this interval, each pair of discs occasionally reversed their direction. After 3–3.8 s, the discs stop, one ring is indicated, and the participant clicks on one disc of that ring."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/HolcombeChen2012BasicTrial.png")
```

We found that even with objects extremely widely-spaced speed thresholds declined dramatically with the number of targets. To us, this appeared to falsify the theory of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a. Indeed, for the 2011 Vision Sciences Society conference where we reported these findings, we entitled our poster entitled "The resource theory of tracking is right! - at high speeds one may only be able to track a single target (even if no crowding occurs". What we meant was that each target takes up some of a very limited processing capacity - a resource that was attentional in that it could be applied anywhere in the visual field, or at least anywhere within a hemifield (\@ref(twoBrains)). The amount of this resource applied to a target determines the fastest speed at which a target can be tracked.

Franconeri, together with his colleagues George Alvarez and Patrick Cavanagh (the latter was, incidentally, my PhD advisor) were not convinced by the findings of Wei-Ying Chen and I. Franconeri et al. continued to push their spatial interference theory of tracking, and moreover they took the idea of spatial interference much further, suggesting that the same basic idea could also explain capacity limits on object recognition, visual working memory, and motor control, writing that "competitive interactions are the roots of capacity limits for tasks such as object recognition and multiple object tracking” (p.2) and that capacity limits arise only because "items interact destructively when they are close enough for their activity profiles to overlap" (p.2) @franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013. Yet to explain the @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 results, the spatial interference posited by Franconeri would have to extend over a very long distance, farther than anything that had been reported in behavioral studies. Furthermore, if there were such long-range spatial gradients of interference present, they should have shown up in the results of @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 as worse performance for the intermediate spatial separations we tested than for the largest separations we tested.

To address these issues with their theory, @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 appealed to data from recordings in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of rhesus macaque monkeys. In a study by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010, the monkeys were presented with a saccade target, and the monkey was cued to execute a saccade to it by offset of the fixation point. In some trials, however, another stimulus was flashed 50 ms prior to the offset of the fixation point. That flashed stimulus was positioned in the receptive field of an LIP cell the researchers were recorded from, and it was found that its response was suppressed relative to trials when there was not a saccade target. This was true even when the saccade target was very far away, with statistically significant impairment at separations up to 40 deg for some cells. There was a spatial gradient, but the data suggested it could be quite shallow, allowing @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 to write that "levels of surround suppression are strong at both distances, and thus no difference in performance is expected" for the separations tested by Holcombe and Chen (2012). Note that @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 was published as an online comment at _Trends in Cognitive Sciences_, as a reply to my online comment pointing out some of the problems with their theory. Unfortunately, some time later, probably in 2018, both comments were lost by the publisher, Elsevier, when they migrated their system. In the case of my comment, however, I found an old version on my computer, updated it slightly and posted it at @holcombeCommentCapacityLimits2019.

One property of the neural suppression documented by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 strongly suggests it is not one of the processes that limit our ability to track multiple objects. Specifically, @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 found that nearly as often as not, the location in the visual field that yielded the most suppression was not in the same hemifield as the receptive field center. But as we will see in \@ref(twoBrains) the cost of additional targets in attentional tracking is largely independent in the two hemifields, suggesting that LIP suppression is not the main factor yielding worse performance when there are more targets. Instead, as @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 themselves concluded, these LIP cells may help mediate a global salience computation for prioritizing saccade or attentional targets wherever they are in the visual field.

In light of all the above, it seemed the evidence ruled against the idea that spatial interference was the sole reason that people perform worse with more targets.  By 2013, the spatial interference account advocated by Franconeri seemed to have been watered down until it was practically indistinguishable from a resource theory. That is, if spatial interference extended over an entire visual field (or hemifield) with no detectable diminution at large separations relative to small separations, then it no longer seemed appropriate to refer to it as "spatial" interference. Instead, finite processing capacity seems to be both a more parsimonious and straightforward description.

The word "resource" appropriately conveys that people can choose how to apply their finite processing capacity, as a resource is something that is available to someone and can be used in different ways. For example, it suggests that one can use half of one's processing capacity for one target while using the other half for a second target. The validity of this part of the metaphor is addressed by some experimental evidence reviewed in \@ref(twoBrains) and \@ref(serialOrParallel).

Having failed to find evidence for long-range spatial interference, I decided to investigate the form of spatial interference that I was confident actually existed: short-range interference. As mentioned in the first section of this chapter, we were already confident that short-range spatial interference existed, from some previous studies of tracking. However, these studies did not provide much evidence about how far that interference extended - either they did not control eccentricity (e.g. @feriaSpeedHasEffect2013) or they only tested a few separations (e.g. @tombuTrackingPlanetsMoons2011). 

In experiments published in 2014, we assessed tracking performance for two targets for various separations between the targets' trajectories [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. Performance improved with separation, but only up to a distance of about half the target's eccentricity, similar to what has typically been found in the crowding literature [@strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014]. In a few experiments there was a trend for better performance even as separation increased beyond the crowding zone, but this effect was small and not statistically significant. In all experiments performance was substantially worse for large separations, even for the largest separation tested of 59 degrees of visual angle. These findings supported my suspicion that spatial interference is largely confined to the crowding range, and that the performance deficit when there are more targets to track is caused by a limited processing resource.

The experiments we reported in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did yield one surprise. In the one-target conditions, outside the crowding range we found that performance actually decreased with separation from the other pair of (untracked) objects. This unexpected  cost of separation was only statistically significant in one experiment, but the trend was present in all four experiments that varied separation outside the crowding range. This might potentially be explained by configural or group-based processing documented by @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020 and others, as grouping of distant elements tends to occur less often than for nearby elements [e.g., @kubovyLawfulnessGroupingProximity1998].

What is the nature of the short-range spatial interference that we and others have documented? As explained in the beginning of this chapter, one cause of spatial interference is simply lack of spatial resolution by the processes that mediate tracking. If a process cannot distinguish between two locations, either because of a noisy representation of those locations or because the two locations are treated as one, then a target may often be lost when it comes too close to a distractor. This would be true of any imperfect mechanism, regardless of whether it is biological or man-made.

While some form of spatial interference or confusion is well-nigh universal, the particular way that the human visual system is put together may result in forms of spatial interference that do not occur in, for example, computer algorithms engineered for object tracking. As described in \@ref(bottlenecks), our visual processing architecture has a pyramid-like structure, with processing at the retina being local and massively parallel, and then gradually converging such that neurons at higher stages have receptive fields responsive to large regions. At these higher stages processes critical to tasks like tracking or face recognition occur. Face-selective neurons, for example, are situated in temporal cortex and have very large receptive fields. For tracking, while the parietal cortex is thought to be more important than the temporal cortex, the neurons in these parietal areas again have large receptive fields.

A large receptive field presents a problem when the task is to recognize an object in clutter or to track a moving target in the presence of nearby moving distractors. In the case of object recognition, without a mechanism to prevent processing of the other objects that share the receptive field, object recognition would have access to only a mishmash of the objects' features. Indeed, this indiscriminate combining of features is thought to be one reason for perceptual illusory conjunctions. Similarly, for object tracking, isolating the target is necessary to keep it distinguished from the distractors.

In principle, our visual systems might include attentional processes that when selecting a target can completely exclude distractors' visual signals from reaching the larger receptive fields. Actually implementing such a system using realistic biological mechanisms with our pyramid architecture, however, looks to be difficult [@tsotsosModelingVisualAttention1995]. Neural recordings reveal that while the signals from stimuli irrelevant to the current task are suppressed somewhat, they still affect neural responses. The particular mechanism used by our visual system appears to include active suppression of a region around a target, which has long been championed by the computer scientist John Tsotsos as a practical way for high-level areas of the brain to isolate a stimulus in their large receptive fields. This suppression likely involves descending connections from high-level areas and possibly recurrent processing [@tsotsosDifferentStagesVisual2008].

Note that on this account, it is only targets, not distractors, that have a region of suppression surrounding them. One consequence of this is that when one tracks more than one target, there is the potential for the targets to suppress each other's selection process. Indeed, this was one basis of the contention of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a that the limit on number of targets that can be tracked was caused entirely by spatial interference. While their attempt to attribute all of the cost of tracking additional targets to surround suppression may be misguided, in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 we did find some tentative evidence supporting a greater range of interference in the two-target condition compared to the one-target condition. Again, the effect was small relative to the total additional-target performance cost. It appears that overlapping surround suppression associated with targets may impair tracking, but the spatial range of this does not extend much beyond the classic crowding range.

<!-- p.11:"the effect of separation was not significantly greater in the two- target condition than the one-target condition, but the difference did approach significance. Experiment 2: F(1, 7) 1⁄4 3.52, p=0.103. Experiment 3: F(1, 9) 1⁄4 3.89, p=0.054. Such an interaction would be consistent with the proposal that attending to an object results in an inhibitory surround, as attention to the two targets could then inhibit each other. This interaction is small, however, relative to the size of the additional-target cost (see Figure 7), suggesting that crowding is not responsible for much of the additional-target cost."
--> 

<!--While the @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a spatial interference theory is still frequently cited uncritically, the evidence against it seems to be strong.-->

Crowding, or the impairment of object identification by nearby objects, has generally been studied more extensively than the spatial interference associated with object tracking. Like for tracking, however, the possibility of suppression around targets remains understudied. Very few studies of crowding have varied the number of targets. I have found one study of the identification of briefly-presented stimuli which found that attending to additional gratings within the crowding range of a first grating resulted in greater impairment in the letter identification task [@mareschalAttentionalModulationCrowding2010]. This is consistent with the existence of surround suppression around each target. <!--Unfortunately, however, the study did not investigate how much further, if at all, spatial interference extended when there are more targets.--> 

<!--As reviewed by @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014, while dozens of MOT papers have manipulated spatial proximity, few have both required fixation and scaled separation with eccentricity such that the relationship of target load and the range of spatial interference could be directly assessed.-->

<!--@maki-marttunenDistinctNeuralMechanisms2019:"In both cohorts, increased load and close encounters (i.e., close spatial proximity) led to reduced accuracy in an additive manner. Load was associated with pupil dilations, whereas close encounters were not. Activity in dorsal attentional areas and frequency of saccades were proportionally larger both with higher levels of load and close encounters. Close encounters recruited additionally ventral attentional areas that may reflect orienting mechanisms. The activity in two brainstem nuclei, ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, showed clearly dissociated patterns. Our results constitute convergent evidence indicating that different mechanisms underlie processing challenges due to load and object spacing."-->

<!--Distractors that pass closer to targets can experience more inhibition (as measured by probes on objects; @doranRoleVisualAttention2010)-->

<!--MENTION THAT HOLCOMBECHEN FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR SPATIAL INTERFERENCE WITH 12 OBJECTS SHARING A CIRCULAR TRAJECTORY-->

In summary, spatial interference likely contributes to many errors in tracking when targets and distractors come close to each other. This may be mediated partly by surround suppression around targets, as well as the inherent ambiguity regarding which is a target and which is a distractor during close encounters for a limited spatial resolution system. When objects are kept widely separated, it appears that spatial interference plays little to no role in tracking. Some other factor or factors, such as some sort of attentional resource, is needed to explain the dramatic decline in tracking performance that can be found with more targets even in widely-spaced displays [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013].
<!--As will become clear in the next section, however, in such conditions, temporal interference can determine tracking performance. -->

## Spatial selection of multiple locations

While multiple object tracking seems to require maintaining selection of moving objects, one can also ask about the capacity to maintain selection of stationary objects. If one cannot select the objects when they are stationary, perhaps one has no chance of tracking them when they are moving. Actually, the differing motion direction of moving objects may facilitate distinguishing among them, which will be discussed in section \@ref(beyondLocation), but nevertheless the processes that allow selection of multiple stationary objects are very likely part and parcel of those that support tracking.

Is selection of static objects resource-limited? @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 investigated this with two concentric circular arrays of stationary dots that were centered on fixation. Between one and eight of the dots were briefly highlighted, and then each dot was replaced by either a small horizontal or a small vertical bar. The participants' task was to search for a vertical bar, which was guaranteed to appear in the previously-cued locations. The participants were to press one key if a vertical bar was present among the cued locations, and another key if none of those locations contained a vertical bar.

In a sparse display with twelve locations, @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 found that average performance dropped from 98% when two locations were cued to 91% when six locations were cued. This decrease is fairly small, suggesting that if the result were to generalize to typical MOT displays, spatial selection processes would contribute only a small portion of the performance decrease with greater set sizes. However, MOT studies frequently allow objects to come much closer to each other than the spacing that @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 used in their sparse condition. In the denser conditions tested by @franconeriHowManyLocations2007, performance again started at a very high level for two cued locations, but dropped much more, to 74% correct or less for six cued locations.

It is difficult to know how these results can be translated into MOT tasks. The selection demands in a typical MOT task may be less taxing than in the @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 experiments, because participants need only maintain their attention on the objects, not search through them. However, it remains unclear how much less demanding that is, so we still do not know how much of the target-load effect in typical MOT displays can be attributed to failures of selection that would occur even were the objects to remain stationary.

In practice, people make many more errors in a tracking task if the targets move than if they do not move (CITATION NEEDED). This observation is not enough, however, to conclude that the limits on spatial selection are not the cause of most errors in moving-object tracking. One reason is that visual working memory can greatly benefit performance with static locations, but memory for locations likely does not update very well in the presence of motion, as will be discussed in section \@ref(identity).

# Unitary cognition (C = 1 processes) {#Cequals1}

Perhaps tracking benefits from two resources. One can process multiple targets simultaneously, even if it processes them more poorly than it processes a lone target. This is what most researchers are interested in, and what they think their data directly speaks to. However, there may be a second recourse involved.

Some cognitive researchers think that aspects of cognitive processing are unitary and can only operate on one thing at a time [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002]. This may be what limits us to doing only one 2-digit mental multiplication problem at a time. When applied to tracking, it means you can apply your full intelligence and powers of reasoning to tracking that target, for example to use what you've learned about object trajectories to predict future positions. I will refer to this as a C=1 process because its processing capacity may be only object.

## An inconvenient possibility
 
<!---This reflects a unitary focus of attention that has an approximate capacity of only one.-->
The possibility that there are two resources that can benefit tracking makes interpreting the results of experiments complicated. It makes a lot of the results trumpeted by tracking papers uninteresting because they could be due to our cognitive abilities operating on a single target, rather than those results speaking to the tracking resource that we can distribute to multiple targets. Many papers that come out of the experimental psychology tradition content themselves with showing that that a factor matters for performance, p < 0.05. Never mind *how much* the factor matters. The p < 0.05 is the only goal. But if the effect is small, its existence could be explained by the unitary C=1 resource. This kind of thinking is a real problem across psychology, and in tracking as elsewhere, it frustrates me. 

As an example, a paper might say that people track multiple objects more accurately with predictable trajectories than with unpredictable trajectories. Well, unless you tell me a lot more, I have to think that may simply be due to our central thought processes operating on just one target. We will describe ways this might be assessed in chapter \@ref(beyondLocation); for now my point is just that this is something to watch out for.

<!--(as opposed to psychophysics, which is more quantitative) -->

If the point remains slightly obscure, another way to put it is that by using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through tracking a single object.

Even when participants are asked to track several targets, then, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets. Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C=1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->

# Objects and attentional spread {#objects}

As I sit in my cluttered living room, sunlight streaming through the window illuminates dozens of objects that reflect light into my retinas. The family dog, which had been napping, gets up and ambles into the kitchen. As he moved, I tracked him with my attention. To do so, something in my brain had to identify a changing set of neurons, responding to different parts of the moving dog, as constituting one object. What sort of processing is involved?

It starts in the retina, but the processing that occurs there is far from enough to segment a dog, or practically any other object, from my living room background. Processing in the thalamus and early visual cortex, at the very least, continues the job. Much, or perhaps all, of this early cortical processing occurs regardless of where one is attending. Exactly how extensive this "preattentive" processing is, and what sorts of representations it results in, has been studied for a while, but much is still not understood [@neisserDecisionTimeReactionTimeExperiments1963; @treismanVerbalCuesLanguage1964; @kimchiFiguregroundSegmentationCan2008].

Attentive tracking is often conceptualized as a process wherein a limited resource simply selects one or more of the preattentively-created representations. In fact, it is unclear whether processing is so neatly divided, with preattentive representations merely selected rather than attention participating in modifying or even creating the representation that is tracked. For example, a popular view is that attending to a location results in binding some of the features there, such as color and orientation, but attention likely also contributes to figure-ground segregation, a more fundamental aspect to defining an object [@petersonLowlevelHighlevelContributions2014]. @nakayamaDynamicNoiseBackground2021 even suggested, in order to explain the twinkle-goes illusion, that attentional tracking could cause the representation of a moving object to persist after the object has disappeared.

<!-- This selection process than allows for continuous monitoring of that entity's changing position as well as other sorts of events, such as detection of probes flashed on the associated stimulus. -->

With behavioral tasks, perhaps the most straightforward assessment that can be done is to investigate which sorts of stimuli can be tracked and which cannot. The first deployment of attention to a stimulus likely occurs more via a spatial or featural index than through an index of the objects in the scene. We cannot think "car" or "tree" to ourselves and expect our attention to deploy directly to any cars or trees in the scene. In contrast, our ability to deploy attention to a cued, static *location* is well-established, as is our ability to deploy attention directly to certain other features, such as color or motion direction. When people are instructed to think about a particular location in the visual field, this results very rapidly in facilitation of perceptual performance for that location, and neural activation in the associated parts of retinotopic cortices. No "search process seemss to be needed, instead spatial location seems to provide a direct conduit for attentional activation. Similarly, for certain features such as motion or color, an instruction to attend to a particular direction, or a particular color, triggers rapid activation across the visual field at all the locations of that color or motion [@saenzGlobalFeaturebasedAttention2003; @whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011].

As a result of this featural selection capability, if a moving target differs from distractors in certain ways, then featural selection can be relied on to keep attention on the target. For example, if the targets are the only yellow objects in the scene, and all the distractors are blue or green, then one can think "yellow" and that is enough to keep attention on the targets and off the distractors (this will come up again in Chapter \@ref(identity)). It is when the targets are identical to the distractors, or not distinguishable from the distractors by one of the features that feature selection acts on, that a different process is needed to keep attention on a moving target.

When the targets and distractors are identical, spatial location selectio may initiate the selection of a target, but if it were the only process operating, when an object moved, attention would be left behind. And a striking characteristic of the experience of tracking is that the movement of attention along with an object feels like it takes no more effort than selecting a static object. Indeed, one might say that attention seems to be positively pulled along - when the targets in an MOT trial begin to move, I have never had the experience of my attention staying behind, remaining at one of the original target locations. It feels unnatural to un-latch my attention from a target and fix it to the target's current location while the target moves on.

The term "object-based attention" is sometimes bandied about as an explanation of why attention seems to automatically move along with a selected object, the idea being that the units of selection are objects rather than locations [@pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006; @clarkLocationLocationLocation2009]. But no one seems to think that direct selection of objects is a thing, in the way that color selection is. That is, one cannot think "chair" and have all the locations of chairs in the scene become rapidly attended. Selection of chairs, or another object type, seems to require a search first, based on locations and simpler features. And even color selection may work via location, with thinking of a color resulting in availability of its locations, and attention then being deployed to those locations [@shihThereFeaturebasedAttentional1996a].

One notion that fits in with these considerations is that attention is deployed first to a location or locations, but any object present can cause spatial attention to spread throughout that object. Although researchers who study the relationship between attention and objects often are not explicit about their theory, this "attentional spread" theory seems to be a popular one. 

## Stationary object selection

Dozens, possibly hundreds, of published papers have investigated the relationship of objects to attention, using a particular kind of cuing paradigm. It all started with @eglyShiftingVisualAttention1994a, who presented two static objects (rectangles) and presented a cue on one end of an object or another. They found that the cue could result in a performance enhancement not only for probes at the location of the cue, but also at the cued object's other end (measured relative to equidistant locations on the second object). The findings reported in most of the many follow-up papers similarly find that participants are fastest and most accurate when the stimulus is presented in the same location as the cue, or on the same object but on a different part of that object. I used the qualifier "most" when referring to the follow-up papers because some papers did not find this [@davisReversalObjectBased2005; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionStrength2008; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionSensory2002; @louIndividualDifferencesTemporal2020], and a major concern is that studies that did not find an advantage were more likely to end up in the proverbial file drawer. In particular, the effect sizes in the literature are often quite small and the studies not highly powered, which can be a red flag that publication bias may have created the illusion of a real effect [@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013].

@francisExcessSuccessArticles2022 assessed the pattern of sample sizes, effect sizes, and p-values in three dozen published object-based attention studies and argue that it suggests that publication bias and/or p-hacking in the literature is rife. This is plausible, because substantial proportions of researchers in psychology and other fields admit to such practices [@johnMeasuringPrevalenceQuestionable2012; @rabeloQuestionableResearchPractices2020; @chinQuestionableResearchPractices2021]. @francisExcessSuccessArticles2022 further point out that the only previously-published study with a large sample (120 participants) found a non-significant effect of only a 6.5 ms difference in response time [@pilzHowPrevalentObjectBased2012], and in their own study with 264 participants, the effect was also quite small, at 14 ms. For an effect of this size, the sample sizes typically used in the published literature were unlikely to yield statistical significance without some help from p-hacking or another questionable research practice. As a result, many papers in the literature make conclusions about objects and attention based on results that unfortunately cannot be trusted.

Publication bias and p-hacking plague many areas of the psychological literature. They are less of an issue when the effects being studied are large, because in those cases studies are more likely to be adequately powered, resulting in fewer false positives and false negatives. The study of object tracking is fortunate that its subject matter has yielded several large and robust effects. Some are so large that spending a period of seconds looking at a display is enough to convince oneself that an effect is real. Those very large effects include some that relate to how variation in objects affects tracking.

## The end of the line

Many objects, such as the letter 'T', are comprised of salient parts. Normally we think of 'T' as a single object, but we can also see that it is made up of a horizontal segment as well as a vertical segment. In conscious awareness, then, we have access to both the whole object level and to an individual parts level. You are able to focus attention on individual bits of the vertical segment, even though there are no visual characteristics that differentiate it. But which level(s) does our object tracking processes operate on?

In early visual cortex, different populations of neurons respond to the the horizontal and to the vertical stroke of a 'T'. But having neurons that respond to a thing does not suffice to be able to track that thing. Only particular kinds of neural representations enable tracking.

@schollWhatVisualObject2001 shed light on this by asking participants to try to track the ends of lines. Participants were presented with four lines, with one end of each line designated as a target. After the movement phase, at the end of the trial participants were to click with a mouse on the line ends that were targets. During a trial, each line grew, shrank, and rotated as each of its ends wandered about the screen randomly.

The notion that one end of an undifferentiated shape is an object is somewhat unnatural. It can be useful, however. When paying attention to someone holding a rifle, for example, it may be important to continuously monitor the direction that the front of the gun is pointing.

![A schematic of the display used by Scholl et al. (2001)](imagesForRmd/linesSchollPylyshynFeldman_madeByHolcombe.png){width=40%}

The results were striking. Performance on the task was abysmal relative to a control condition in which the two ends of the line were not connected. Simply by viewing an example trial, one very quickly gets a sense of how difficult the task is - the effect is very large.

(ASK SCHOLL FOR THE MOVIE RIGHTS)

The task of tracking line ends in the experiment of @schollWhatVisualObject2001 experiment was complicated by the fact that the objects frequently crossed over each other and also their length changed over time, raising the question of whether these factors were the reason why tracking was difficult. Follow-up work by @howeCanAttentionBe2012, however, showed that these were not the main reason for the poor performance. It simply is the case, it seems, that one cannot confine one's tracking processes to one bit of an undifferentiated object. 

Our inability to track the ends of lines fits in with the view this chapter opened with, that preattentive processes define objects that become what tracking operates on. This relates to an aspect of experience with static images. Maintaining attention on a part of the visual scene in the absence of anything in the image to delineate that part *feels like* it requires concentration, as if we must continually think about what we are supposed to be attending to. If lots of cognitive resources are needed to maintain the "object" representation when it is not provided by preattentive processes, it is possible that one can track a single target but not more. This idea of C = 1 (capacity of one) processes being involved or required for some forms of tracking is discussed more in \@ref(whichAspects). 

## Object creation and object tracking: Distinct processes?

Conceptually, researchers distinguish between the processing that determines *how many* objects one can track and those that determine *what kinds* of objects can be tracked. But do these things happen in different processing stages, or do they interact? An assumption of separate processing stages is popular in the study of visual cognition generally. Visual search, for example, is usually conceptualized this way [@wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997; @nakayamaVisualSurfaceRepresentation1995], and appears to be an implicit assumption in two reviews of objects and tracking  [@schollObjectsAttentionState2001; @pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006]. <!-- No interaction between number of objects to track and what kinds of objects can be tracked.--> 

```{r simpleArchitecture, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="A schematic of the idea that objects are created prior to the action of tracking processes, which then point to the already-formed object representations but do not change them."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/flowDiagrams/objectCreationTrackingSeparateDiagram.png")
```

It would be convenient if object creation and object tracking occurred at distinct processing stages, as that is straightforward relative to an interactive system [@simonSciencesArtificialReissue1969; @sternbergDiscoveryProcessingStages1969]. And there certainly is evidence that tracking is  high-level, for example @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021 found evidence that tracking operates on perceived object position rather than more low-level representation of position.

There is evidence, however, that attention and object creation are interactive. For example, the way stimulus elements are organized by attention can determine what illusory contours are created and perceived, as well as the lightness and depth that is perceived [@harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019; @harrisonAttentionalSelectionIllusory2019; @peterVoluntaryAttentionModulates2005].  Our ability to perceive the complex motion of a human body from only several points of light highlights that object perception can involve hierarchical motion segmentation that reflects an interaction between Gestalt grouping and top-down knowledge of the overall shape of objects and the relative motion pattern of their parts [@johanssonJohanssonVisualPerception1973; @wangSearchingLifeMotion2010] (see the grouping Chapter (\@ref(grouping))).

Using a paradigm based on that of the attentional spread literature reviewed above, @ongchocoHowCreateObjects2019 asked participants to practice "seeing" certain shapes in a uniform grid of lines. The detection of flashed probes was enhanced for those presented on the same (purely imagined) object, compared with equidistant ones presented on different objects. In summary, a variety of evidence suggests a role for neural feedback in object segmentation, with some role for attention, but the extent of its importance remains unclear [@papaleInfluenceObjecthoodRepresentation2021; @wyatteEarlyRecurrentFeedback2014; @harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019].
 
Potentially, the same attentional resources that mediate tracking may also contribute to the creation of object representations. One consequence would be a trade-off between the involvement of attention in constructing object representations and the number of objects that can be tracked. Informal experience with tracking the line ends in the @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 display seems to support this. If when you watch the SCHOLL MOVIE, you concern yourself with keeping track of the end of only *one* object, you are likely to succeed. But recall that it is difficult or impossible to accurately track *four* object ends - indeed, @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 found that participants' performance was approximately that predicted if they could track one line end, but not more. This finding is consistent with the notion that some aspects of object creation tap the same attentional resource as tracking does.

An important alternative, however, is that our minds harbor a tracking resource that can be brought to bear on one object, but not multiple objects. This would mean that covert tracking of multiple objects is qualitatively different from covert tracking of a single object. It may seem unparsimonious to posit this, but in fact there seems there is both a hemifield-specific tracking resource and a more global resource. This is discussed further in \@ref(twoBrains).

## What tracking sticks to

Even when all of our cognitive resources are brought to bear on a single entity, some sorts of entities still can't be tracked. @anstisEyesPursueMoving2010 asked participants to track the intersection of two shapes, a configuration that causes the "chopsticks illusion" @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990. In the "chopsticks illusion", a horizontal and vertical line slide over each other, each following a clockwise circular trajectory. Viewers perceive the intersection of the two lines to also be moving clockwise (demo [here](http://anstislab.ucsd.edu/illusions/chopsticks-illusion/)), but in fact the intersection moves only counterclockwise. This seems to be, in part, a failure of object tracking because if participants had been able to attentionally track the intersection, they should have been able to judge its trajectory. Moreover, @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 found that participants could not accurately pursue the intersection with their eyes. The true counterclockwise trajectory of the intersection becomes obvious perceptually if one views the display through a window so that the ends of the lines are occluded rather than visible, and in that condition participants could smooth pursue the intersection accurately. @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 believe the reason that the intersection is ordinarily perceived to move in the wrong direction is because the clockwise motion of the ends of the lines is mistakenly assigned to the intersection, similar to how the motion of the ends of lines causes the barber-pole illusion. Regardless of the cause of the illusion, it constitutes a failure to track a rather simply-defined point. Evidently, a particular interpretation of motion and form was created and tracking could not effective operate on the simpler intersection of the lines. As schematized by the figure above, certain processing of motion and form appears to occur prior to the operation of tracking. <!--As we will see, however, there is also reason to believe that attention can mold some object representations.-->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Some stimuli used by Howe et al. (2012). CC-BY"}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/PiersHowe/PiersHoweStimuli.png")
```

"The ends of the line" section above described the finding that people can't track the ends of multiple objects. Evidently, maintaining the representation of an undifferentiated part of an object is not something that our multiple object tracking resources are capable of. What sort of differentiation is needed? @schollWhatVisualObject2001 varied how distinct the end of an object was. In a "dumbbell" condition, each object was simply two squares connected by a line. In that condition, participants' accuracy was lower than the original separate squares condition, but not statistically significantly so - any detriment to tracking appeared to be small, suggesting that participants could track a dumbbell end. However,  @howeCanAttentionBe2012 also used a dumbbell condition that was rather similar to that of @schollWhatVisualObject2001, but they found performance was substantially lower than when the objects (which were discs in their case) were not connected. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, and it appears it could reflect the noisiness of the data of the two studies. @howeCanAttentionBe2012 also tested a "luminance" condition, pictured above, and found that performance (80% correct) was substantially lower than their baseline condition (96% correct), although not as low as for undifferentiated bar ends (72% correct). They were surprised that the clear difference in luminance between the targets and the connector in the luminance condition was not enough to keep tracking from being so adversely affected by the connectors.

These results suggest that multiple object tracking uses a more "primitive" segmentation of objects than what is available to us when we focus our attention on a single object. These findings have some similarity to those found in conjunction visual search studies. @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997, for example, asked participants to search for conjunctions of features, such as red and vertical. If the vertical red part of an object were physically connected to a horizontal and green part, then participants were much slower to find the red vertical target segment in the display, among the green vertical and red horizontal distractors. In other words, it seemed that physically connecting one feature to another lumped it together as an undifferentiated collection of features from the perspective of search processes, what @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997 termed a "preattentive object file". Although to my knowledge, no researcher has tested displays of this nature for both tracking and search <!--FUTURE-->, the parsimonious account has to be that multiple object tracking and search operate on the same object representations.

## Growth, shrinkage, and tracking

In the real world, some objects and substances change shape.  When one opens a faucet in a kitchen, for example, a jet of water will shoot into the sink, and flatten on the sink's bottom, rapidly expanding into a puddle. As one pours beer into a glass, a froth forms, which gradually thickens as the top of the liquid rises. These are examples of non-rigid motion, in these cases substances that change shape as they move.

To investigate tracking of non-rigid substances, @vanmarleAttentiveTrackingObjects2003 devised an object that resembled an inchworm or slinky. In a condition I will refer to as the "slinky" condition, each object began as a square. It would then move by extending its leading edge until it had the shape of a long and thin rectangle. Subsequently, the trailing edge of the slinky, which was still at its original location, would retract until the slinky was a square again, now entirely at a new location. In this condition, tracking performance was very poor. <!--the substances condition difficulty seems to be accounted for by this problem--> What is it about tracking that causes such difficulty with slinkys? @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 tested a number of conditions that ruled out issues such as the faster speed of the slinky's edges relative to the control conditions.

@schollWhatHaveWe2008 suggested that the reason the slinky was difficult to track was that "there was no unambiguous location for attention to select on this shrinking and growing extended object" because "each object’s location could no longer be characterized by a single point" (p.63). There may be something to this, but it is not entirely clear what is meant by an object's location not being characterizable by a single point. Consider the canonical objects used in this literature - discs with no internal features. They also have no unambiguous internal locations, because their insides are a completely undifferentiated mass. If one wishes to refer to a single point for their location, their centroid could be used, but this seems just as true for an object changing in size and shape. Additionally, in the chopsticks illusion reviewed above, the target was defined by a single point (the intersection of two lines), but it also could not be tracked.

Although the reason remains obscure, it seems that object expansion and contraction disrupt not only tracking, but also localization. @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 replicated the tracking results of @schollWhatHaveWe2008. They also investigated further, presenting a rectangle for 200 ms at a random location on the screen, and asking participants to click on the location of the center of the rectangle. In a baseline condition, the rectangle did not change in size, shape, or location during its 200 ms presentation. In the size-change condition, the length of the object increased due to expansion for half of the interval and shrank due to contraction during the other half. Participants' localization errors were about 14% larger in this changing-size condition. This appeared to be driven by errors along the axis of the object's expansion and contraction, as errors in the orthogonal direction were not significantly different from the baseline condition.

The localization impairment documented by @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 was substantial, and thus may yield the very low performance when participants attempt to track multiple slinkys. However, it still is not clear whether the localization impairment is large enough to account for the very low tracking performance. An important next step is to measure localization errors when the task is to monitor multiple objects changing in size rather than just one. If the localization deficit caused by change in size worsens with object load, this would help implicate the processes underlying tracking <!--FUTURE-->.

## Could tracking work by attentional spreading?

The relationship between object representations and tracking pictured by Figure \@ref(fig:simpleArchitecture) suggests that attention selects entire object representations, as a whole. It has been suggested, however, that he process instead begins by selecting a particular location, and then selection spreads up to the edges of the object. A gradual growth of the area of attentional activation to encompass an entire object has been observed neurophysiologically in certain tasks [e.g., @wannigAutomaticSpreadAttentional2011].

The spreading of attention could conceivably explain the ability to keep attention on multiple moving objects. When an object moves, if it moves smoothly, then its leading edge will occupy new territory while its trailing edge continues to occupy an old location. If spreading of attention up to object boundaries is continually occurring, then attention should spread to the new locations near the trailing edge. In such a fashion, attention could, by continually expanding to the new location of a leading edge and contracting with a trailing edge, stay on a moving object. However, the neural spreading process observed neurophysiologically seems too slow to keep up with fast-moving yet trackable objects.

Behavioral results from presenting probes at various locations inside and outside of moving targets adds to the complexity here. Presenting probes during a task of tracking multiple lines, @alvarezHowDoesAttention2005 found that probes presented at the center of objects were detected much more accurately than end probes, suggesting that attentional resources were concentrated on the centers of the lines. The spreading account seems to instead predict that accuracy would be highest near the trailing end of an object. It appears, however, that the researchers did not analyze the data to check whether of the two object ends, accuracy was higher for probes at the trailing end. Clearly, much more work is needed to reveal the nature of attentional spread while an object moves and any role that has in facilitating tracking.
<!-- Point objects, stepping objects (works for 1 target and probably for multiple ones if they are stepping a short distance, but I know of NO studies of MOT with apparent motion FUTURE), and the finding that attention tends to be ahead of an object? I don't recall whether that's been done --> 
<!-- Reminescent of how rapid eye movements (saccades) tend to go to the centroids of objects.-->

<!--Out the kitchen window, in the dense foliage of a tree, two birds squabble on the wing. As they plummet from one branch to another, you see only parts of each at any one time. An outstretched wing partially obscured by leaves and a branch, which folds in on itself as the bird alights on a branch and parts of its body comes into view. In addition to occlusion, camouflage can also cause the visible portions of animals to change in shape as they move from one background to another.-->

<!--Many questions remain regarding what sorts of objects attention gloms onto.


This proposition, that there are actually two resources that can assist tracking, one with much more limited capacity (perhaps for just one object) and the other with fewer capabilities but higher capacity, is an intriguing one but not-->

# Grouping {#grouping}

Carving the scene into objects is not the only form of visual segmentation that our brains perform. We perceive groups formed by a variety of cues. This suggests that tracking might follow entire groups rather than individual elements of a group. @alzahabiEnsemblePerceptionMultipleobject2021 used clusters of several discs as targets and distractors. These clusters maintained a constant spatial arrangement as they wandered about the display. Participants seemed to do well at tracking these clusters. Unfortunately these researchers did not rule out the possibility that participants were tracking just one disc of each cluster, however, and I am not aware of any work that provided strong evidence that a tracking focus tracks an entire group.

@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesized that in MOT experiments, participants track an imaginary shape formed by the targets, specifically a polygon whose vertices are the target positions. Progress has been slow in understanding whether all participants do this or just a minority do, and in what circumstances. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 found a result that they took as evidence that some participants track a shape defined by the targets while others do not. In their task, when the targets and distractors stopped moving at the end of the trial, four of them were highlighted again and the task was to press one button if all four were targets (match), and to press a different button otherwise (non-match). Error rates were lowest when none of the objects highlighted were targets, and errors were progressively more common as the number of highlighted objects that were targets increased. This was unsurprising. However, for trials where all four of the highlighted objects were the targets (match), error rates were much lower than when only three were targets. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 suggested that this reflected a "perceptual strategy of monitoring the global shape configuration of the tracked target items." They went on to split the participants based on whether they had a relatively low error rate in the match condition, investigated the neural correlates of that, and made various conclusions about the neural processing that underlies virtual shape tracking.

These inferences of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 are all based on the split of participants based on low error rate in the match condition compared to the condition where none of the highlighted objects match. The idea seems to be that if participants weren't using a shape tracking strategy, error rates would steadily increase from the trials where none of the highlighted objects were targets to the trials where all of the objects highlighted were targets. However, there are other possible reasons for this pattern of results.

One aspect of the @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 experiment is that one of the two response choices (non-match) was the correct answer in 80% of trials. Because participants were not told that, some of them surely expected that they should press the two buttons approximately equally often. By pressing the match button more often (close to 50% of trials) than the appropriate 20% of trials, they would artificially have the relatively low error rate for the full-match condition that was observed. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 mention the possibility of a response bias but suggest that this would result in the opposite (a high error rate) to what I have suggested. The problem seems to be that they didn't consider that the participants may have expected the match stimulus to occur more often than it did.

A response bias is not the only alternative to the virtual grouping account of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014. The  low error rate in the full-match condition might also occur for other reasons. Imagine that a participant tracked only one target and simply checked that target at the end of each trial for whether it was highlighted. If that one target is not highlighted, the participant presses the non-match button, otherwise they press the match button. For such a participant, the chance of getting the answer wrong when none of the probed objects are targets is zero. It is higher when one of the probed objects is a target (25% if the participant tracks one target perfectly on every trial and makes no finger errors), and still higher when two or three probed objects is a target. When three probed objects are targets, in three out of four cases, one of them is the target the participant tracked, so the participant frequently gets it wrong. But when all four of the probed objects are targets, the participant will always respond correctly. Thus, a low error rate in this all-targets-probed condition that is very close to the error rate in the no-targets-probed condition can be a sign of a participant who only monitors one target. But @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 interpreted this result as instead meaning that the participant was tracking a virtual shape formed by all four of the targets.

<!--This doesn't address their correlation argument. Correlation predictions. Simplest version of my account is that only lapse rate differs between participants. High lapse rate contributes most to M0 and M4 variance, so if lapse rate is driving individual differences, correlation between M4 and M0 should be higher than M4 with other conditions, which it is. But for M1 and M2 I'm not sure why correlations so high.

Does Pearson correlations not affected by base rate for an error rate variable? I think not, so if there is a floor effect for M4, it should have a smaller correlation with everything else. But actually M0- has the lowest error rate and it has higher correlations.

What if you track three targets? Decision rule: if all three match, say yes, otherwise no. Then in M4 you will get 0% error rate again. With M3, 25%? error rate, then smaller for M2, M1, M0.  

Why would you ever say 'no' in M4? It would have to be because you ended up tracking the wrong target(s). But if you know you sometimes end up tracking a wrong target(s), if 3 of your 4 targets match 3 of those highlighted, then maybe your decision rule is to say 'yes'. So then sometimes you get M4 wrong. And in M3, you could get even more wrong, because you are happy with just 3 being the same. In M2, you might get less wrong.

Participants could differ in A) lapse rate; B) number tracked; C) decision rule.
They claim that half of participants have a big difference . But these might be the non-holistic participants. If I track holistically, with some noise in my virtual polygon representation I get M4 most correct? I get M3 most wrong, M2 less wrong, M1 even less, and M0 all correct.

-->


<!--Imagine you just check one target on every trial for whether it is highlighted. Chance of getting it wrong is zero at M0 ,progressively higher for M1, M2, and M3. But then at M4, should go back to zero. So this effect is unsurprising. And if you select people with low error rates for M4, you might be grabbing people who only tracked one target. But Merkel probably think they're grabbing people who tracked holistically.

They correlated M4 with everything else, and those correlations were lower than M1 with M2, M2 with M3, etc. Whereas all participants responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the match-0 trials, about half of the participants also responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the full-match trials. These latter participants also tended to make more errors on match-3 trials than did the other half of the participants.
-->


## Hierarchical relations 

In the real world, the movement of a scene relative to our retinas is rarely as independent as the moving objects in a typical multiple object tracking experiment. Often there is a strong motion element throughout the visual field created by the movement of the observer, and recovering true object movement likely requires detecting deviations from that [@warrenPerceptionObjectTrajectory2007]. Even when the observer is completely still, hierarchical motion relationships are common. When one views a tree on a windy day, the largest branches sway slowly, while the smaller limbs attached to the larger branches move with the larger branches but also, being lighter, have their own, more rapid motion.

These aspects of the structure of the visual world may be one reason that our visual systems are tuned to relative motion [@tadinWhatConstitutesEfficient2002; @maruyaRapidEncodingRelationships2013]. When we see a wheel roll by, we experience individual features on the wheel as moving forward, reflecting the global frame of the entire wheel, but also as moving in a circle, reflecting the motion relative to the center of the wheel.

This decomposition of the rim's movement is so strong that people systematically mis-report the trajectory of the points on the wheel [@proffittUnderstandingWheelDynamics1990]. The red curve in the animation below reveals that a point on a rolling wheel traces out a curve that involves up, down, and forward motion, but no backward motion. The trajectory reported by participants is very different and tends to include a period of backward motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="The red curve is that traced out by a point on a rolling wheel, by Zorgit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cycloid_f.gif"}  
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f_static.png")
```

@billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020 varied the structured motion pattern of the moving discs of an MOT task to show that hierarchical relations are extracted and used to facilitate tracking. The attentional demands, if any, of such hierarchical motion decomposition has not been explored much.

<!-- Mention the bendy-pencil illusion https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193187 maybe.  "the illusory bending motion may be due to an inability of observers to accurately track the motions of features whose image displacements undergo rapid simultaneous changes in both space and time" -->

## Eyes to the center

The human visual system represents scenes as more than just a collection of objects. Our brain's rapid global analysis of visual scenes gives us summary information that is sometimes referred to as ensemble statistics [@alvarezSpatialEnsembleStatistics2009]. One such ensemble statistic is the location of the center or centroid of the objects. This is useful for eye movement planning, among other things — to monitor a group of objects, it is helpful to look at the center of the group, as that can minimize how far into peripheral vision they are situated. 

In 2008, @zelinskyEyeMovementAnalysis2008 and @fehdEyeMovementsMultiple2008 independently reported that during multiple object tracking, in addition to gazing directly at targets, the eyes of many participants frequently are directed at blank locations near the center of the array of targets. This basic finding has been replicated by subsequent work [@hyonaEyeBehaviorMultiple2019]. The nature of the central point — whether it is the centroid or something else — is not entirely clear. Researchers have suggested that it may be the average of the targets' locations, or the average location of all the moving objects (both targets and distractors). Another possibility that has been investigated is that participants tend to look at the centroid of the shape formed by the targets, which recalls the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that what is tracked is the shape defined by the targets. Finally, @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 introduced the idea of the "anti-crowding point", which is the point that minimizes the ratio between each target's distance from the gaze point and distance from every distractor. The idea was that participants move their gaze closer to a target when it is near a distractor to avoid confusing targets with distractors.

In a comparison of all these metrics against eyetracking data, @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 found that the anti-crowding point best predicted participants' gaze in his experiment, followed by the average of the target locations. These points both matched the data better than the centroid of the targets. This undermines somewhat the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that a virtual polygon is tracked, and the finding of best performance by the anti-crowding point is consistent with other results that participants tend to look closer to targets that are near other objects 
[@vaterDisentanglingVisionAttention2017; @zelinskyRoleRescueSaccades2010].

More work must be done to understand the possible role of an anti-crowding eye movement strategy. Because spatial interference in displays does not seem to extend further than half an object's eccentricity, in both static identification tasks [@pelliUncrowdedWindowObject2008' @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011] and multiple object tracking [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014], the anti-crowding point devised by @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 ought to be pitted against a measure incorporating the finding that distractors further than about half an object's eccentricity do not cause spatial interference and thus can perhaps be excluded from the calculation.

# Two brains or one? {#twoBrains}

A human brain can be thought of as made up of two brains, a left and a right, just as we have two legs and two hands. 
<!--While an industry of education consultants and "brain training" companies exploits  common left brain, right brain misconceptions,  
We all have a "left brain" and a "right brain", which have different learning styles, and they should be trained both separately and in a way that gets them communicating with each other. Or so many would have you believe. The anatomical division of the hemispheres has been hyped into a supposed plethora of implications for behavior and learning. A veritable industry of education consultants and "brain training" providers have peddled these ideas, selling programs they refer to as, for example, "left brain versus right brain" training [@kroezeBrainGymPseudoscientific2016].--> Much of sensory and perceptual processing is very specific to the two halves of the cortex, but more cognitive functions such as declarative memory benefit from a very tight integration. Indeed, this integration is extensive enough that the comparison of our two hemispheres to our two hands is misleading.

Our conscious experience, too, is highly unified. We experience no discontinuity when the movement of our eyes, or of an object, cause an object to shift from one hemifield, where it is processed predominantly by one hemisphere, to the other hemifield. Communication between the two hemispheres happens rapidly and continuously, and there is no good evidence that exercises designed to insure both hemispheres process stimuli have any benefit for learning. 

In "split-brain" patients, many of the connections between the hemispheres have been lost. Despite the loss of these connections, such patients can still perform visual search in both hemifields, indicating that both hemispheres have the capacity to do that task. Indeed, when split-brain patients are asked to search for a target among many distractor objects, spreading the load by distributing the distractors across the two hemifields can yield a large benefit, suggesting that the two hemispheres in these patients carry out their searches independently [@luckIndependentAttentionalScanning1994a]. For intact individuals, no such advantage is seen, suggesting that the processes that evaluate each stimulus for whether it is the target are integrated across the hemispheres into a single attentional focus [@luckIndependentHemisphericAttentional1989].

While performance in search and other behaviors typically shows a tight inter-hemispheric integration, the two hemispheres do specialize for certain functions. The left hemisphere specializes in language functions such as reading, while the right hemisphere is better at recognizing faces. A behavioral consequence of this is that response times for a face recognition task are slightly faster when the stimulus is presented wholly in the left hemifield (to the right hemisphere) than when it is presented wholly in the right hemifield, whereas the opposite is found for word reading [@rizzolattiOppositeSuperioritiesRight1971]. However, with extended time to process a stimulus, such behavioral asymmetries can disappear as the information from one hemisphere is communicated to the other.

In the performance of most perceptual and attentional tasks, then, in humans with an intact brain there is little sign that that brain is divided into two halves. Multiple object tracking, however, constitutes a major exception to this. This tells us that the limited resource that determines how many objects one can keep track of resides largely with a process that operates independently in the two hemispheres.

In 2005, George Alvarez & Patrick Cavanagh reported a stunning finding. In an MOT task, they used objects that resembled spinning pinwheels. An individual bar of each object could be designated as a target. Performance in a two-target (one bar of each of two different pinwheels) condition was contrasted with that  for a one-target condition [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005].  When the second target was positioned in the same hemifield as the first target, accuracy in the two-target condition was much worse (89% vs. 63%). Remarkably, however, when the second target belonged to a pinwheel located in the opposite hemifield, there was very little performance decrement - accuracy was 93% in the one-target condition, and 90% correct in the two-target condition. This suggests that the processes that limit successful tracking in this task are largely specific to each hemifield. 

It was already known that sensory processing and quite a lot of perceptual processing occurs independently in each hemisphere. What is surprising is that a highly limited-capacity processing ability would be hemisphere-independent. Such capacities were traditionally thought to be among the processes that are tightly integrated across the two hemispheres, forming a single resource "pool", not two independent limits. We will get back to this point, first we'll examine more extensively the evidence for hemispheric independence of object tracking.

The hemispheric independence of a task can be quantified. Imagine that adding a second stimulus to a hemifield reduces performance by 20 percentage points, but adding that stimulus to the other hemifield reduces performance by only 5 percentage points. One can quantify the hemispheric independence, then, as (20-5) / 20 = 75% hemifield independence. Ideally, however, one would not use raw accuracy but instead would correct for the accuracy one can achieve by guessing. When [applying such a calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd) to the @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 results, the estimated level of independence is very high: `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE1Independence)`% independence in one of their experiments, and `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE3Independence)`% in the other. 

@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 themselves, like most others who have investigated this question, did not do these calculations. @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 calculated expected performance if the hemifields are in fact completely independent, and reported that performance was not statistically significantly worse than that figure. They then suggested that there was complete independence, but this is based on the common fallacy of concluding a null hypothesis is true when the evidence does not reject it at a p<.05 level [@aczelQuantifyingSupportNull2018]. That is, for the null hypothesis they started with their conclusion of complete independence, and then affirmed this conclusion on the basis of not finding much evidence against it. Nevertheless, their data do suggest hemispheric independence of approximately 90%. In a study with similar methods, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 found `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence (they did not calculate a number, so this is [my calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)).

Some of the follow-up studies in this area have not included enough conditions to quantify the degree of independence, or confounded distribution of the targets to two hemifields with greater distance among them, such that any benefit might have been due to less spatial crowding interference, a phenomenon discussed in section \@ref(spatialInterference).

@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @chenResourceDemandsObject2013 found similar results with a slightly different approach based on speed thresholds, which are discussed in section \@ref(speedAndTime). The findings were compatible with approximately 100% hemifield independence or a bit less. @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010<!--Figure 1--> and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 also found evidence for a substantial bilateral advantage compared to adding a target in the same hemifield. 

These findings of hemispheric independence has not replicated in all circumstances [e.g., @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008] <!--performance in all the conditions involved in their comparison were greater than 85% correct, including many low speeds where performance was near ceiling -->  <!--For most of these tasks, but not @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010, more targets was confounded with having to make more responses and remember said responses at the end of the trial, so some of the residual cost could be due to that being unitary rather than hemifield-specific.-->, but the successful replications strongly suggest that at least in some circumstances, tracking does occur mostly independently in the two hemispheres. I say "mostly independently" rather than suggesting complete independence because each individual study has too much statistical uncertainty to rule out a figure such as 75% independence, even when its mean suggests a higher degree of independence.

@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 suggested that the reason they did not find evidence for hemifield independence is that they used only two targets, whereas according to them the original @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 report of hemifield independence used four targets. This is unlikely to be the reason for the discrepancy, however, because in their E1 and E2 @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 did find evidence for hemifield independence using just two targets, as did @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014. The @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 data may have been afflicted by a ceiling effect, as accuracy was over 85% correct in all conditions in their experiment. 

<!-- Shim, Alvarez, & Jiang (2008) found no advantage for targets in different hemifields. Why? Not sure, but the objects weren’t spaced far enough part to not crowd each other across the hemifield boundaries. In contrast, Shim et al. and Bello et al. suggest it was because hemifield limit doesn’t apply when just two targets. Holcombe & Chen found it did, but Bello suggests the reason is that we used circular trajectories that are somehow different, they say you can extrapolate more with them, whereas it may be that you can extrapolate less.   The target-target distance effect in Shim et al. is huge! How do I explain that? One possible explanation is Carlson’s quadrantic deficit.-->

A limitation of deriving hemispheric independence from accuracy is that they depend on the assumption that if a person can only track one target, if one then adds a second target, the person will succeed just as often in tracking one of them. But my introspective experience indicates that in some circumstances, if one tries to track both targets, one will fail at both, and thus one is better off only trying to track one. The reason for this may be that a certain amount of resource is needed to track a target, and so if neither target is allocated that much resource, tracking will fail for both. Evidence for this was provided by @chenResourceDemandsObject2013. In the terminology introduced by @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975, the resource function that relates the proportion of attentional resource to accuracy falls below a straight line. This means that quantitative estimates of hemispheric independence will be overestimates, particularly in circumstances where the participants do not realize they may be better off focusing their efforts on tracking fewer targets than the number they have been told to track.

@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007 found evidence not only for hemifield independence but also quadrant-level independence, which they attributed to the partial separation of the retinotopic quadrant representations in areas V2 and V3. Using different stimuli, @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 and @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did not, however, find evidence for this: they did not find evidence for a deficit when two targets were positioned in the same quadrant compared to different quadrants but in the same hemifield. More work on this topic should be done.

## Some tracking resources are NOT hemifield-specific

One attentional process that is not hemifield-specific is feature attention, for example attention to color. When a participant is told to look for a red target, they are able to use feature attention to enhance all red objects, no matter where they are in the visual field [@whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011]. The decision to look for red originates with cognitive processes and remains hemifield-unified rather than hemifield-specific at the level of visual cortex [@saenzGlobalEffectsFeaturebased2002]. Indeed, people seem to be unable to confine the enhancement of red objects to one hemifield [@loHowWeSelect2014]. In real-world tracking where objects are at least somewhat heterogeneous and thus targets often have a different average color and other features than distractors, feature attention will facilitate tracking, and this facilitation is not hemifield-specific.

A previous section introduced the idea of C≈1 cognitive processes that can support tracking of a single target but perhaps not multiple targets. Such processing likely is not hemisphere-specific, being aligned with "central executive" processes that integrate processing in both hemispheres. <!--We easily attend to objects in any part of the visual field, left or right.-->

@chenResourceDemandsObject2013 found evidence for both hemifield-specific tracking processes and processes not specific to a hemifield operating in the same MOT task. Two targets were used, and on some trials they moved at different speeds. When a slow-moving target was paired (presented in the same trial) with a speedier target, accuracy was lower for the slow-moving target than if it was paired with a target that was slower. This suggests that participants allocate more tracking resources to the faster of two targets, presumably because slower targets do not require much resource to track well. This trade-off was most pronounced when the two targets were in the same hemifield, but seemed to occur to some degree even when the two targets were in different hemifields, implicating a cross-hemifield resource that plays a small role. This cross-hemifield resource may be a C=1 process. Most cognitive tasks are unlikely to be independently mediated by the two hemispheres, with one set of processes in each hemisphere.

Finally, as discussed in the next section, perturbing one parietal lobe can affect performance in both hemifields, which suggests that each hemisphere can in some circumstances mediate tracking in either hemifield.

## The underlying mechanisms

The evidence reviewed above for hemifield independence suggests that hemisphere-specific processes determine how many targets one can track. This raises the question of what sort of processes those are, and how they interact with the cognitive processes that are more integrated across the hemispheres.

Steve Franconeri and colleagues have championed the idea that the hemisphere independence stems from spatial interference processes, by suggesting that these processes occur largely within a hemisphere [@franconeriNatureStatusVisual2013]. The idea is that when when an object is tracked, the neurons representing that target in retinotopic cortical areas activate inhibitory connections to nearby neurons in the cortical map, suppressing the responses to neighboring objects [@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007. To explain the findings of hemifield specificity, what's been added to this account is the idea that the inhibitory neural connections do not extend from one hemisphere's retinotopic map to another [@franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013]. The evidence that as manifest in classic crowding tasks, spatial interference does show a discontinuity across the left- and right-visual field boundary lends some plausibility to this idea [@liuReductionCrowdingEffect2009]. However, @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 found evidence against spatial interference extending any further than the classic crowding range , which is only half the eccentricity of an object - for example, an object placed six degrees of visual angle from where the point the eyes are looking at would be interfered with only by other objects closer to it than three degrees of visual angle [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970a]. This is a far cry from the nearly 90 degrees of an entire hemifield, or even of a quadrant. The more viable theory, then, is those that align more with the concept of a neural resource that spans the hemifield.

A number of studies have found that the activity of some parietal and frontal areas of cortex increase steadily with the number of targets in MOT [@culhamAttentionResponseFunctions2001; @howeUsingFMRIDistinguish2009; @jovicichBrainAreasSpecific2001; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014; @nummenmaaCorticalCircuitBinding2017], consistent with the importance of a pool of attentional resources. These studies did not focus, however, on the extent to which these activations are specific to the hemifield-specific nature of target load. The only imaging study I am aware of that investigated the issue is @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 who found an activation difference when the objects designated as targets were in opposite hemifields compared to when they were in the same hemifield. This was found for the superior parietal lobule and transverse parieto-occipital area, but not the anterior intraparietal sulcus. 
<!--"In behavioral performance, participants tracked with higher accuracy when the 2 target pinwheels fell in opposite hemifields than in the same hemifield. A corresponding difference in brain activity was observed in the SPL (P < 0.05) and TrPO (P < 0.005), where activity was higher for track-2 unilateral than track-2 bilateral. The visual field arrangement did not affect activity in aIPS, however (P > 0.10), revealing a possible further dissociation in the PPC between the anterior and posterior" -->

The neural correlates of the hemifield-specific resource was investigated by @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 using EEG. They found that the SSVEP activation for targets was higher than that for distractors, especially when the two targets were positioned in different (left and right) hemifields. In contrast, an ERP component known as the P3 thought to reflect more cognitive identification and decision processes was similar in the two conditions. This is consistent with the theory that tracking depends on both hemisphere-specific attentive processing followed by some involvement of higher-order processes that are not hemisphere-specific.

@battelliRoleParietalLobe2009 found they could disrupt MOT performance in a hemifield by stimulating the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Importantly, however, this only occurred when the moving targets were present in both hemifields. When the targets were all in the left or all in the right hemifield, TMS to the left or to the right IPS had no effect on tracking accuracy, and this was replicated in a second experiment. These findings bring to mind the competition between the two hemifields that is evident in the "extinction" symptom observed in parietal neglect patients. In extinction, responding to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to parietal injury only shows significant impairment if there are also stimuli presented to the ipsilateral hemifield. This inspired Battelli to explain their findings with two propositions. The first is that the IPS in each hemisphere can mediate the tracking of targets in *either* visual hemifield. The second is that under normal conditions, inhibitory processes reduce the amount of ipsilateral processing by each IPS, causing tracking capacity to effectively be hemifield-specific in many circumstances.

The complex relationship of the hemispheres is further illustrated by evidence from patients. @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 found that in patients with damage to their right parietal lobe, MOT performance only in the left visual field was impaired relative to control participants. Evidently the right parietal lobe does not normally mediate tracking in the right visual field, so losing it did not hurt right visual field tracking performance. But for another task, these right parietal patients had substantial impairments in *both* hemifields. Impairment on that task, an apparent motion task, is believed to be a result of a deficit for registering the relative timing of visual events. The involvement of the right parietal lobe, but not the left parietal lobe, in judging the temporal order of stimuli in both hemifields was further supported in an additional study with both patients and with TMS [@agostaPivotalRoleRight2017].

In summary, while there is evidence that each parietal lobe is involved in field-wide processing for some tasks, it also likely mediates the hemifield independence evident in some circumstances. Using ERP, @drewSoftHandoffAttention2014 fund evidence that when a target crosses the vertical midline, say from the left to the right hemifield, the left hemisphere becomes involved shortly before the target reaches the right hemifield, and the right hemisphere remains involved for a short time after the crossing. Because this was modulated by predictability of the motion, it did not appear to be wholly mediated by the well-known overlap of the two hemispheres' receptive fields at the midline. This phenomenon may reflect the normally-inhibited ipsilateral representation of the visual field by parietal cortices highlighted by @battelliRoleParietalLobe2009, although the location the ERP signals originated from was not clear so this remains uncertain.

Both @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 and @minamiHemifieldCrossingsMultiple2019 found evidence for a tracking performance cost when a target in MOT crossed the vertical midline. Evidently the handoff of control from one hemisphere to another is not completely efficient. @saikiRobustColorshapeBinding2019 also found wome evidence in a memory paradigm that when two objects moved between hemifields, memory for their features was more disrupted than when they moved fron one to another quadrant within the same hemifield. @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 also found no cost when targets moved between quadrants while remaining within a hemifield, an important finding given that other work raised the prospect of quadrant-specific resources [@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007]. 

In summary, areas of the parietal cortex may subserve both the hemifield-specific tracking resource that dominates most MOT tasks and the more limited resource that is not specific to a hemifield. More work must be done however to determine the role of frontal lobe regions. Such regions could potentially play a role in the hemifield-specific resource, the hemifield-independent resource, or both.

## What else are hemifield-specific resources used for?

Multiple object tracking is closely associated with spatial selection, which is an important process for many other visual tasks. Given the hemifield specificity of spatial attentional selection suggested by MOT, then, one might expect to find strong hemifield-specificity of other visual cognition tasks in addition to MOT. 

Many researchers have examined tasks involving two simultaneously-presented stimuli and compared performance when the two stimuli are presented in the same hemifield to performance when they are presented in different hemifields. For example, @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971 found that the reporting of two briefly-presented digits is more accurate when the digits are presented in different hemifields than in the same hemifield. However, this study and many others did not include a single-stimulus condition, so when performance is higher in the split condition, we don't know how close that is to the one-target level of performance and thus the degree of hemifield-specificity cannot be quantified. Other studies use response time as a measure, which is also difficult to interpret [@awhEvidenceSplitAttentional2000; @serenoDiscriminationHemifieldsNew1991; @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971]. 

<!-- A' is no good https://sites.google.com/a/mtu.edu/whynotaprime/ -->
@delvenneCapacityVisualShortterm2005 used both dual-target and single-target conditions in a visual working memory task. For spatial working memory, he estimated 40% hemifield independence, although unfortunately he used the discredited A' measure of performance [@zhangNoteROCAnalysis2005] and did not space the stimuli widely enough to reduce the possibility of spatial interference. Nevertheless, the advantage appears to be large and did not occur for color working memory [@delvenneVisualShorttermMemory2012]. More generally, only tasks with spatial demands seem to show much hemifield specificity [@holtBilateralAdvantageMaintaining2015; @umemotoBilateralAdvantageStorage2010]

@alvarezAnatomicalConstraintsAttention2012a studied visual search, with the items to search through arrayed bilaterally or unilaterally. In standard visual search, they found only a small advantage of the vertical meridian split. However, in a subset search task where participants knew the target would be located in one of several locations designated by a pre-trial cue, they found a large bilateral advantage. However, when the relevant locations were prominently indicated by a color difference, this advantage largely disappeared. These results, and those in the rest of the literature, suggest that hemifield advantages are strongest when spatial selection is critical.

@strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 investigated working memory for stimuli that moved either within a hemifield or between hemifields. For between-hemifield movement, they found a substantial decrease in accuracy for the spatial task of remembering which positions of a 2x2 grid contained dots at the beginning of the trial, before the (empty) grid moved - 79% correct for between-hemifield movement, and 85% correct for within-hemifield movement. No such cost was found for color or identity memory tasks. This between-hemifield cost for spatial memory was similar to the cost they found for MOT itself.

This association between spatial tasks and hemifield specificity may reflect a large-scale difference in how the brain processes spatial versus identity information. Famously, the dorsal stream that leads to the parietal cortices are more concerned with spatial information than is the ventral stream that is more involved in object recognition [@goodaleSeparateVisualPathways1992]. Neural responses in the dorsal pathway to parietal cortex are largely contralateral [@serenoMappingContralateralSpace2001], although as we have seen . This is also true of other brain areas thought to contribute to a "saliency map" [@fecteauSalienceRelevanceFiring2006], such as the frontal eye fields [@haglerjrSpatialMapsFrontal2006], the superior colliculus [@schneiderVisualResponsesHuman2005], and the pulvinar [@cottonContralateralVisualHemifield2007a]. In contrast, identity-related processing seems to involve more bilateral neural responses and connectivity between hemispheres [@cohenUsingNeuronalPopulations2011; @hemondPreferenceContralateralStimuli2007].

Multiple identity tracking, which is discussed further in section \@ref(identity), combines the location-updating aspect of multiple object tracking with an additional requirement: maintaining knowledge of what features belong to each of the objects. Across four experiments, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 consistently found partial hemifield independence, ranging from 26 to 37% (my calculation of this is [here](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)) with a paradigm that yielded `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence for MOT. This is consistent with the suggestion of the findings listed above that a spatial selection and/or location updating processes are much more hemisphere-specific than processes that require maintenance of non-spatial features.

## Hemispheric differences

Neural differences between the left and right hemispheres can be attenuated at the behavioral level by the cross-hemisphere integration that typically occurs prior to a behavioral response. The functional independence of the two hemispheres for multiple object tracking, then, provides a greater potential to show hemifield differences in performance. As it turns out, differences are observed, but these differences do not seem to be large.

In four experiments conducted by @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014, we reported either a trend for or statistically significant advantage for targets in the right hemifield (Figure A2). <!--Interestingly, there was some non-significant evidence that this was greater in their one-target condition than in their two-target condition.    Figure 4 of @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 like Holcombe et al. (2014) finds (non-significant) better tracking performance in RVF than the left only when tracking one rather than more than one--> A right hemifield advantage might potentially be explained by the theory that stimuli presented to the right hemifield are processed by both hemispheres to a greater degree than are stimuli presented to the left hemifield, which is also thought to explain why left neglect is more common than right neglect. Specifically, it is thought that the right hemisphere mediates attention to *both* hemifields [@mesulamSpatialAttentionNeglect1999], such that the right hemifield is doubly represented. However, while @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 confirmed a right hemifield advantage in their MOT experiments, they instead find a left visual field advantage for spatial working memory experiments, even though spatial working memory is also though to be mediated by parietal cortex. Most strikingly, @matthewsLeftVisualField2015 found a large advantage for temporal order judgments and simultaneity judgments for stimuli presented to the left hemifield. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that the left hemifield advantage for timing tasks reflects a specialization for timing in the right parietal cortex [@battelliBilateralDeficitsTransient2003], even though human specialization for language, which is thought to be in part an enhancement of timing and sequencing abilities, has occurred more in the left hemisphere.

The situation becomes even more complex once one considers that there subtle interactions between the two hemispheres seem to affect attention in each hemifield, as highlighted in the "the underlying mechanisms" section above. One illustration of this is a recent finding by @edwardsBehavioralGainFollowing2021. They had participants perform MOT in either hemifield for a 30 min session, and afterwards found that performance in the *untrained* hemifield improved significantly. The reason for this is not clear, but could reflect "fatigue" by the hemisphere contralateral to the trained hemifield causing it to reduce its inhibition of the other hemisphere. Alternatively, the mechanism could be potentiation of the untrained hemisphere as a result of the deprivation, which may be the reason why depriving one *eye* results in increased cortical activity when that eye is stimulated later [@lunghiBriefPeriodsMonocular2011].

# Knowing where but not what {#identity}

Consider what someone means when they say they are keeping track of something, for example their family. That likely would mean knowing where each of their siblings is, where their mother is, and where their father is. But the multiple object tracking task does not test peoples' knowledge of the different identities of targets. Rather, the targets are typically all identical to each other (and to the distractors) and people need only report where the targets are.

This section is about what you know about the objects you are tracking. The broad answer is: surprisingly little. We should break the question down, however, into two questions. A first question is about how position updating works - does it use differences between the distractors' and targets' features to help keep track of the targets? A second question is about the extent to which targets' features are available to conscious awareness.

## The first question: Does position updating benefit from differences in object identities?

### Motion correspondence 

Computer algorithms have been developed for object tracking to facilitate detection of intrusions and safety threats in industrial settings. They are also used for analyzing the movements of players of an opposing team's previous games as well as the movements of animals in lab experiments. When developing tracking algorithms, engineers do not confine themselves to using only the locations and motions of objects - they also use the appearance of those objects, for example their shapes and colors. This helps the algorithm match objects across video frames (the correspondence problem, sometimes known as the "data association problem" in engineering)  [@yilmazObjectTrackingSurvey2006a]. This allows successful tracking in situations where location and motion alone would result in losing a target.  

Of course, the fact that object features would be useful for the brain to use for tracking does not necessarily mean that the brain does use them. One aspect of the architecture of the brain suggests that it might not. Famously, as visual signals leave the occipital cortex, visual processing divides into two streams, ventral and dorsal. The dorsal stream, sometimes called the "where" pathway, specializes in motion and position processing, while the ventral stream, the "what" pathway, specializes in object recognition [@goodaleSeparateVisualPathways1992]. While the pathways do interact, this  division raises the possibility that position updating might not involve much processing of objects' features. <!--
"erhaps most famously, these sorts of processes seem to be localized in anatomically distinct corti- cal streams (e.g., Livingstone and Hubel 1988), with the ventral pathway corresponding to identification, and the dorsal pathway corresponding to individuation. In addition, a variety of behavioral evidence supports this distinction." The surface features of objects (e.g., their colors and shapes), while obviously critical for many visual processes including object recogni- tion, seem to be largely discounted by many other processes (for a review, see Flombaum, Scholl, and Santos, in press). For example, surface features play little or no role in determining apparent motion correspondence (Burt and Sperling 1981), identity over time in the tunnel effect (Flombaum et al., 2004; Flombaum and Scholl 2006; Michotte, Thinès, and Crabbé 1964/1991), or object-specific priming (Mitroff and Alvarez 2007)." [@schollWhatHaveWe2008]-->

Beginning over a century ago, Gestalt psychologists such as Max Wertheimer found that apparent motion was equally strong whether the objects in successive frames were identical or different [@wertheimerExperimentelleStudienUber1912]. Later studies found some effect of similarity, but the effect was weak [@kolersFiguralChangeApparent1971; @burtTimeDistanceFeature1981]. These findings contributed to the dominant view that the visual system does not use feature similarity much when computing motion correspondence to update a moving object's position. Some caution is justified, however, because
 when the successive presented frames of an object touch or overlap with each other rather than being presented in non-contiguous locations, the results can be different. The study of such displays, with a different object appearance (usually, shape) in two successive frames, is known as line motion or transformational apparent motion. These studies have found that feature similarity, especially contour continuity, but also color, can decide which tokens are matched [@faubertInfluenceTwoSpatially1995; @tseRoleParsingHighlevel1998]. Thus, feature similarity is involved in motion processing, even though in many situations motion correspondence is determined by spatiotemporal luminance relationships. An important characteristic of this process that does does not seem to have been studied, however, is whether these cues are processed in parallel. Short-range spatiotemporal luminance relationships ("motion energy") are known to be processed by local detectors, such that visual search happens in parallel for a target moving in an odd direction defined by small-displacement apparent motion [@horowitzAttentionApparentMotion1994]. I am not aware of any studies that have investigated this for transformational apparent motion, in a situation where the perceived motion direction is determined by feature similarity. Thus, the possibility remains that feature similarity has its influence through what I have called a C=1 process (\@ref(Cequals1)).

<!--Unfortunately, it is difficult to test participants on whether they know during tracking the characteristics of an object when, as soon as the question is asked, they can focus their attention on the probed object and encode its features for report. But some insight into this issue can be gained by considering the studies conducted by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009.-->

### Feature differences, but not feature conjunction differences, benefit tracking

Another way that object identity information might benefit position tracking is via the action of feature attention. A clear case is if the targets differ in color from the distractors. It is well-established that attention can select stimulus representations by their color. One can, for example, enhance the selection of all red objects in the visual field. @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 confirmed that this process can benefit MOT. They used eight moving objects, four of which were targets. MOT performance was better than when the eight objects were different in color than when they were identical. This was also true whe the objects were each a different shape.

A large body of evidence from other paradigms has supported the theory of @treismanFeatureIntegrationTheory1980 that feature pairing information, in contrast to individual features, cannot efficiently guide attention to targets. If the splitting of attention among multiple locations that occurs in MOT is similar to how attention is diffused over multiple stimuli in visual search and other paradigms, then one would expect that targets having unique feature pairings would not benefit tracking performance. @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 found good evidence for this. In their "feature conjunction" condition, each object had a unique pair of features, while it shared the individual features with at least one other object. <!--create illustration maybe from diagrammeR--> Performance was no better in this condition than if the objects were all identical. <!--This finding is consistent with Anne Treisman's perspicacious thesis of over forty years ago that focused attention is needed for many sorts of binding. When tracking multiple targets, then, the pairing of the features cannot be used to distinguish targets from distractors. Only in the conditions where feature binding was not necessary did featural differences benefit tracking performance.-->

<!--Treisman, as well as many subsequent researchers, went further than this and theorized that feature pairing information only becomes available if attention focuses on -->

## The second question: Are we aware of the identities of objects we are tracking?

<!--FUTURE With the motion silencing illusion, it goes not occur for an object that one is tracking. I don't think any papers exist that make this point, or tell us whether the reason is because you're parsing away the motion from the change signal, or whether you actually have to compare feature values. Related phenomena are temporal camouflage and Saiki's original moving change blindness with occlusion findings . It also probably explains why infants don't process object features, because there is no cue to get them to update the object features.  Also the Wikipedia entry needs lots of work and should cite Saiki & Holcombe -->

We are of course aware of object features when the only task we are engaged in is tracking a single target. In that situation, our limited-capacity processes can all be applied to that target. However, when we are tracking multiple targets, the evidence indicates that we have little ability to report the objects' features, other than their locations, as we will see below.

<!-- A powerful demonstration that does not fully show lack of awareness of identities, but certainly shows how motion can obscure change in identities, is the motion silencing illusion [@suchowMotionSilencesAwareness2011]. If you have not seen it, I high recommend you [have a look](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-silencing/). The lack of awareness of the color changes succeeds partly because the color changes do not change the overall proportion of each color at a global level - this phenomenon was documented by @saikiBlindnessSimultaneousChange2012 in work prior to the discovery of the illusion. Another ingredient is the density of the display, which discourages ACTUALLY YOU CAN NOTICE THE CHANGES IF YOU TRACK, SO HOW IS THIS RELEVANT? -->

A common view among the public is that lack of awareness of the features of objects one is attending to could not happen. Indeed, many people seem to believe that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in the central portion of our visual field, so unless an object actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everything in the scene is at all times, and we should immediately detect any changes to these objects. For many, change blindness demonstrations are the first experience that disrupts this belief.

Experiments suggest that during change blindness, although people cannot monitor a large number of objects at once, they are able to monitor several, perhaps four or five [@rensinkVisualSearchChange2000]. They appear to do this by loading the objects into working memory and then, in the second frame, checking whether any are different than what is held in memory. A vast literature on visual working memory has confirmed that people can store several objects and rapidly compare these stored representations to the visual scene. However, loading into memory the features of objects for storage and subsequent comparison is not the same as maintaining awareness of the changing features of such objects. For one thing, it appears that hundreds of milliseconds are needed to encode several objects [@vogelTimeCourseConsolidation2006; @ngiamVisualWorkingMemory2019]. Second, it appears that when objects are in motion, updating of their features is particularly poor, as we will see in the next section.

When Zenon Pylyshyn published the first theory of multiple object tracking, he had already devised the concept of FINSTs (Fingers of Instantiation), a small set of discrete pointers allocated to tracked targets. The idea was that each discrete pointer allows other mental processes to individuate and link up with an object representation, with the continued assignment of a pointer to a target facilitating its representation an object's representation as the same persisting individual [@pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989].

Pylyshyn's theory implied that when tracking multiple targets, people should know which target is which. To his credit, Pylyshyn tested this and other predictions of his theory, and when the results turned out differently than expected, he published his results, in two papers. The first paper was entitled "Some puzzling findings in multiple object tracking: I. Tracking without keeping track of object identities". In one study in that paper, targets were assigned identities either by giving them names or by giving them distinct and recognizable starting positions: the four corners of the screen [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2004]. At the end of a trial, participants had the usual task of indicating which objects were targets, but also were asked about the identity of the target - which one it was. Accuracy at identifying the targets was very low, even when accuracy reporting their positions was high. <!-- target-target confusions could explain this -->

More evidence for a disconnect between knowledge of what one is tracking and success at the basic MOT task was found by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007, who had participants track targets with unique appearances - in one set of experiments, they were cartoon animals. At the end of a trial, all the targets moved behind occluders so that their identities were no longer visible. Participants were asked where a particular target (say, the rabbit) had gone - that is, which occluder it was hiding behind. This type of task was dubbed "multiple identity tracking" by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004. Performance was better than chance, but was much worse than performance for reporting the target locations irrespective of which target it was. The effective number of objects tracked, as reflected in a standard MOT question, was about four, but when asked to indicate the final location of a particular animal, capacity was estimated as closer to two objects.

These results of MIT experiments suggest that our ability to update the location of objects of interest is much better than our ability to maintain knowledge of what those objects are. This harkens back to Pylyshyn's original idea that tracking is mediated by pointers that in and of themselves, only point to locations and don't contain other featural information. Pylyshyn thought that these pointers, being unique and distinct, did provide us with knowledge of which target location at the end of a trial corresponded to a particular target at the beginning of a trial. However, his own experiments ruled against that - the tracking process seems to deploy something to the moving targets that carries absolutely no information about those targets other than their positions.

Given enough time, we certainly can update our representation of not only the locations of targets but of their features. For example, in visual short-term memory experiments, on successive trials people memorize different location-feature mappings for several objects. Thus, if moving objects were simply to move very, very slowly, we should be able to update our awareness of what is where before any target travels more than a trivial distance. However, a quite recent study yielded some results that further showcase the limitations of our identity updating abilities.

## Beaten by a bird brain

<!--For instance, @schollRelationshipPropertyencodingObjectbased2001 found that when items stopped moving, observers were able to accurately report the previous direction and speed of targets but not of nontargets. However, when the shape or color of the items was masked, observers were unable to accurately report the premask features of either targets or nontargets.-->

@pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 conducted a test that at an abstract level, was similar to Pylyshyn's experiments, with identical objects assigned unique identities. @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020, however, used a format much like the "shell game" utilised by magicians and hustlers for hundreds of years. The engaging nature of the shell game format made it suitable for testing children and an African grey parrot as well as human adults. This led to a few surprises.

For stimuli, @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 used colored balls of wool. Between one and four of the balls were shown to a participant. The experimenter covered the balls with inverted opaque plastic cups, and then began to move them, swapping the positions of one pair at a time. After a variable number of pairs were swapped, the experimenter presented another ball with one of the target colors, and the participant's task was to point to (or peck on!), the cup containing the probed color. 

![An African grey parrot participates in a shell game. Pailian et al. (2020), CC-BY .](imagesForRmd/ParrotGriffinPepperbergShellGame.png){width=40%} 

At any one time, only two objects were in motion, and that the participants were responsible for knowing the final location of all the colors - there were no distractors. One might anticipate that at least the adults would be able to perform this task with high accuracy, especially given that at any one time, only two objects were in motion and the experimenter paused for a full second between swaps, which ought to give people enough time to update their memory of the locations of those two colors.

When only two balls were used, over 95% accuracy was seen even for four swaps, the highest number tested. This was true of all three participant types: the children, the parrot, and the human adults. In the three-ball condition, for the children, who were 6 to 8 years old, performance was still near ceiling for the zero-swap (no movement) condition, but fell to close to 80% correct  in the one-swap condition, and fell to around 70% correct for two and three swaps. The adults did better, but still their performance fell with number of swaps, to about 80% correct for four swaps. Remarkably, the parrot actually outperformed not only the children, but also the human adults. Importantly, the parrot had not been trained extensively on the task, learning it primarily by simply viewing the experimenter and a confederate perform three example trials (the parrot was experienced with a simpler version of the task involving only one object presented under one of the three cups).

The biggest surprise here is that an African gray parrot had the ability to remember and update small sets of moving hidden objects to a level of accuracy similar to humans, despite having a much smaller brain than ours, less than one-fiftieth the size of our own in fact. Because large parts of the parrot brain evolved after they split from our lineage [@iwaniukInterspecificAllometryBrain2005], the existence of this ability in its brain looks to be an example of convergent evolution.

A second surprise was that the adult humans (in this case, Harvard undergraduates, who surely had high intelligence on average) displayed levels of accuracy that was not very high for the conditions that involved more than a few swaps. Remember that in these experiments, only two balls were moved at a time, and there was a one-second pause between swaps. Prior to the publication of this study, I had assumed that the reason for poor performance in multiple identity tracking was the difficulty of updating the identity of three or four targets while they moved. I would have predicted that changing positions exclusively by swapping the positions of two objects, and providing a one-second pause between swaps, would lead to very high performance. The @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 results suggest that updating the memory of object locations is very demanding. 

This finding was also surprising based on the long-accepted concept of "object files" developed by @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992. The idea was that all the features of an object are associated with a representation in memory, the object file, that is maintained even as the object moves. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 showed a preview display with two rectangles, with a feature (in most experiments, a letter) presented in each. The featural information disappears, and then the rectangles would move to a new location. The observer's representation of the display is then probed, for example by presenting a letter again in one of the rectangles and asking participants to identify it. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 
found that if the letter was the same as the one presented in that rectangle at the beginning of the display, observers were faster to respond than if it had appeared in another rectangle in the beginning of the display, indicating that that aspect of the rectangle's initial properties was maintained, with its location updated. The focus in these studies was on simply demonstrating that this response time priming occurred at all, not in assessing what proportion of time it occurred.

Many researchers may have made the same mistake that I did of assuming that several object files could easily be maintained and updated. However, even in the original experiments of @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992, they found that the amount of priming was greatly diminished when four letters were initially presented in different rectangles, indicating that fewer objects than that had letter information maintained and updated. They concluded that there may be a severe capacity limit on object files. This was also supported by a pioneering study by @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002, who had participants view a circular array of colored discs that rotated about the center of the screen. Occasionally discs swapped color when they briefly went behind occluders, and the participants' task was to detect these color switches. Performance decreased dramatically with speed and number of discs, even though the motion was completely predictable, and @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 concluded that "even completely predictable motion severely reduces our capacity of object representations, from four to only one or two." Bcause we now understand that simple MOT does not work well across occluders, however, that interpretation of the study is limited by the absence of an MOT-type control. Nevertheless, the evidence from the studies in this chapter overall suggests that identity updating is very poor in a range of circumstances.

## Some dissociations between identity and location processing reflect poor visibility in the periphery

If it is the case that participants cannot update the identities of the moving objects that they are tracking nearly as well as they can update their positions, why is that? The results of an eye tracking study by the Finnish researchers Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä led them to conclude that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process. Eye movements during MOT were contrasted with those during MIT, in which the targets and distractors were line drawings. During MIT, participants looked directly at targets frequently, totalling around 50% of the trial duration, and frequently moved their eyes from one target to another. In contrast, during MOT, the participants moved their eyes infrequently, and their gaze wasn't usually at any of the moving objects, rather they were usually looking somewhere close to the center of the screen. @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 took these results to mean that the targets' identity-location bindings that must be updated during MIT are updated by a serial one-by-one process, whereas target positions during MOT are updated by a parallel process.

What @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 did not address is that limitations on human peripheral vision mean that participants may have had to update target identity information one-by-one. That is, the targets, line drawings of different objects, likely were difficult to identify when in the periphery. Thus, participants had to move their eyes to each object to refresh their representation of which was which. Indeed, in a subsequent study  @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 tested discriminability of the objects in the periphery and found that accuracy was poor. <!-- The conclusion by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process that determines the movement of the eyes may well be correct.-->
 When they instead used colored discs as stimuli, accuracy was higher in the periphery and participants did not move their eyes as often to individual targets. This suggested at least some degree of parallel processing, leaving the amount of serial processing, if any, in doubt.

<!--@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 did not assess how far in the periphery the target objects were identifiable - the only study I know of that did this is a later paper by the Finnish team, specifically @liModelMultipleIdentity2019. They tested discriminability of line drawings from the same database as those used by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016, while also testing the discriminability of faces and colored discs. More specifically, they first presented a sample stimulus at fixation (either a face, a line drawing, or a colored disc, depending upon the block of trials) and subsequently in the periphery they presented either the same stimulus or another stimulus from the same category. The task of participants was to judge whether this peripherally-presented stimulus was the same or different. For the faces and the line drawings, percent correct decreased a substantial amount with distance from the fovea. However, for the color task, percent correct was the same at all three eccentricities tested (2.5, 5, and 7.5 deg).    Forget a bit about what it looks like. don't have to classify among all the options-->

In summary, many findings of differences between MIT and MOT performance may be explained by poor recognition of the targets in the periphery. Because most studies of MIT do not include an assessment of how recognizable their stimuli are in the periphery (@liModelMultipleIdentity2019 is the only study I know of that did this), it is hard to say how much of the difference between MIT and MOT can be attributed to this. I am not sure how one would equate object localization with object identifiability; the old apples and oranges problem. One could blur the objects to impair localization but it is not clear what degree of spatial uncertainty is comparable to a particular level of object identifiability.

One dissociation between identity and location tracking performance seems to remain valid regardless of the difficulty of perceiving object identities in the periphery. This is the original finding by @pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989, which was replicated by @cohenWhatwhereTradeoffMultipleidentity2011 that if targets are actually identical but are assigned different nominal identities, participants are very poor at knowing which is which at the end of the trial. Because in this paradigm, there is no visible identity information and participants knew this, the resolution of the periphery was not an issue.

## Evidence from two techniques suggests parallel updating of identities

<!-- To some extent, however, we're comparing apples and oranges. This study should be replicated with another sample of participants, however, and using a method that directly compares MIT (knowledge of target identities) to MOT (knowledge of targets' locations) by including distractors, not just targets. Without that, there is some concern that the presence of the experimenter was distracting or that some other idiosyncrasy of the paradigm led to poor identity performance.--> 

<!--These claims of a process that is serial and one-by-one are not based on rigorous tests of serial processing like those progressively elaborated by Jim Townsend and colleagues since the 1980s [@algomFeaturesResponseTimes2015; @townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Rather, it is based on more indirect evidence such as the visual search results that originally led Anne Treisman to propose a serial feature binding process.-->

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a used two techniques to investigate the possibility that serial processes are involved in multiple identity tracking. First, Howe et al. applied the simultaneous-sequential presentation technique that they previously applied to MOT,
as discussed in \@ref(serialOrParallel). For the MIT task, four targets of different colors moved among four distractors. Each of the four distractors was the same color as one of the targets, so that the targets could not be distinguished from the distractors by color. In the simultaneous condition, all the objects moved for 500 ms and then paused for 500 ms, with this cycle repeating throughout the length of the trial (which varied randomly between 8 and 16 s). In the sequential condition, half the targets moved for 500 ms while the other half were stationary, and subsequently the other half of targets moved for 500 ms while the others remained stationary. This cycle repeated throughout the length of the trial. In two different versions of the experiment, performance was similar in the simultaneous and sequential conditions, supporting the conclusion that there was no serial process involved in multiple identity tracking. However, the @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a conclusion is limited by its assumption that any serial process could respond efficiently to the pause in half the targets by shifting its resources to the moving targets, while not causing any forgetting of the locations and identities of the temporarily-stationary targets. To support this assumption, @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a pointed out that @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 had shown that attention could move at much faster rates than 500 ms per shift. However, the @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 did not assess the attention shifting time between unrelated targets, rather their shifts were for attention stepping along with a single target disc as it moved about a circular array. Thus, it is unclear to what extent the results of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a undermine the serial, one-by-one identity updating idea embedded in the theories of Oksama & Hyönä and @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019.

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a further investigated serial versus parallel processing in MIT by using a completely different technique: the systems factorial technology of Jim Townsend and colleagues [@townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Two targets were designated for tracking and presented in the same hemifield, to avoid independence by virtue of the hemispheres' independence [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005]. The participants were told to monitor both targets as they moved and that if either of them darkened, to press the response button as quickly as possible, after which all the disks stopped moving and the participant was asked to identify the location of a particular target, for example the green one (the objects were identical during the movement phase of the trial but initially each was shown in a particular color). To ensure that participants performed the identity tracking task as well, only trials in which the participant reported the target identity correctly were included in the subsequent analysis. Performance detecting the darkening events was very high, at 95% correct. On different trials, either both targets darkened, one of them darkened, or neither of them darkened, and each could darken either by a small amount or by a large amount. <!--Because it's a response time analysis, it's measuring parallel or serial processing, which may be different somehow from possibly serial processing for individuating a target or solving the correspondence problem for it. In that case, the actual processing time is time-limited by the stimulus, whereas you can let a slow parallel accumulator eventually do its thing when the stimulus information isn't time-curtailed. In other words, attention might focus on one because it absolutely has to get done, but that would mean switching its strategy adaptively based on difficulty--> The pattern of the distributions of response time for the various conditions ruled out serial processing (under certain assumptions) and implicated limited-capacity parallel processing. This suggests that participants can process luminance changes of two moving targets in parallel while also maintaining knowledge of the identity of the moving targets. One reservation is that it is unclear how often the participants needed to update the target locations and refresh their identities, because the rate at which they needed to be sampled to solve the correspondence problem is unclear for the particular trajectories used. <!--The fact that identity tracking accuracy was over 95% suggests that the task was easy, but still--> It also would be good to see these techniques applied to targets defined only by distinct feature conjunctions, with no differences in features between the targets and the distractors. Because this would prevent any contribution of feature attention, and because processing of feature pairs may be more limited-capacity than that of identifying individual features, the results might provide less evidence for parallel processing.

<!--PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THIS, MOMIT 2.0 UPDATED -->

## Eye movements can add a serial component to tracking

Partially in response to the evidence of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a against serial processing in tracking, Oksama and Hyona, with their Chinese colleague Jie Li, revised their Model of Multiple Identity Tracking (MOMIT) to involve more parallel processing. Specifically, MOMIT 2.0 proposes that the "outputs of parallel processing are not non-indexed locations but proto-objects that contain both location and basic featural information, which can be sufficient for tracking in case no detailed information is required" [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. This is a reasonable response to the evidence, even if it unfortunately means the theory doesn't make as strong predictions, as the role of serial processing is now more vague. In MOMIT 2.0, serial processing is tied to eye movements and is used to acquire detailed visual information for refreshing working memory representations. This "prevents the resolution of the active representations from declining. This is vital for tracking targets that require high-resolution information to be identified and kept distinguishable from other targets." The theory seems to be mute on whether serial processing would be involved if both fixation were enforced and the stimuli were easily identifiable in the periphery.

Here it is sensible to step back and consider the overall role of eye movements in ecological task behavior. People move their eyes on average three times a second, in part because like many other animals, our retina has a specialized part (the fovea) that is adaptive to direct at whatever object we are most interested in at the moment. In natural tasks, it may be rarely the case that all the visual signals of interest are clustered together enough that they can be processed adequately without eye movements. Moreover, animals such as ourselves have strong drives for exploration and vigilance because we evolved in changing environments about which we had only partial knowledge.

Eye movements normally contribute a serial, one-by-one component to processing, because as @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 highlighted, very high-quality information comes from only a single region on the screen - the region currently falling on the fovea. Near-continual scanning of the visual scene is a deeply ingrained habit, and extends to artificial tasks like reading. Not only are saccades  frequent during reading, but one influential theory of reading proposes that an internal rhythm drives saccades from one word to the next rather than them being triggered by the completion of a process such as word recognition [@engbertDynamicalModelSaccade2002]. Perhaps, then, one should expect frequent eye movements to occur and contribute a serial component of processing to a range of tasks even when such eye movements are not necessary. People are also cognitively "lazy" in that they seem to structure eye movements and other actions in tasks so as to minimize short term memory requirements [@hayhoeTaskConstraintsVisual1998]. Thus, even if saccading to different targets were inefficient, people may do it anyway.

To move the debate regarding the role of serial and parallel processing forward, we should recognize that the frequent eye movements associated with natural behavior should be expected in tracking, as for any task involving multiple relevant stimuli, and this can contribute a serial processing component, even if people can perform the same task in a much more parallel fashion when eye movements are constrained. The most interesting evidence for serial processing, then, may be that found when eye movements are prohibited. This is one reason that the steep decrease in apparent sampling frequency discovered by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 (see section \@ref(serialOrParallel)) may be very important.

<!--The Finnish team of Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä may have done the most studies of the task they dubbed multiple identity tracking (MIT) in 2004 [@oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004], introduced above in the version used by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007. Based on results includning those I have reviewed here, since 2008 Oksama and Hyönä have been advocating a model that tracks the locations of moving objects with a parallel process, but updates other featural information with a serial, one-by-one process [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. -->

<!--They say Holcombe & Chen 2013 found big evidence for serial because "when objects move along the same trajectories (e.g., Holcombe & Chen, 2013) and/or are close to each other, high resolution information is required for discriminating the objects. Thus, tracking becomes more serial" but they don't seem to say anything about how different trajectories benefits performance-->


<!--Preventing the use of feature attention
The effectiveness of featural attention raises an important issue for the interpretation of MIT studies. All the MIT studies I reviewed above did not have targets and distractors distinguished only by their feature conjunctions; rather, they typically used unique shapes such as cartoon animals or line drawings. This raises the possibility that the targets sometimes shared some feature or features with each other more than with the distractors. In other words, feature attention could help separate the targets from the distractors. This could be avoided by using pairings of features, as in the feature conjunction condition used by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 for MOT. Another approach was used by Piers Howe and colleagues who paired each target, which had a distinct appearance, with a distractor that had an identical appearance.-->

In summary, there is plenty of evidence that both use of object identities in tracking and the updating of target identities for awareness is quite poor. This fits with a much broader set of findings over the last thirty years, that the mind maintains fewer explicit visual representations than we intuitively believe. The first findings of change blindness, which were in the context of failures to detect changes that occurred during eye movements [@mcconkieRoleControlEye1979], led @oreganSolvingRealMysteries1992a to suggest that "the world is an outside memory" and to discover change blindness [@rensinkSeeNotSee1997]. The idea was that the impression that one has a rich representation of all the objects in the visual field is an illusion, and instead that one has only a more limited knowledge, but that this is quickly supplemented by attentional processing when one becomes interested in a particular location or object. It appears that O'Regan's big idea goes further than he anticipated. While O'Regan suggested that only when objects  were attended would they be fully processed, he did not suggest that one might be able to track the changing locations of multiple targets without becoming aware of what they are. Such lack of awareness has been documented not only in the context of tracking multiple objects as reviewed above, but even in a change blindness task that involved eyetracking of just a single target as part of an ongoing, more complex task [@trieschWhatYouSee2003].


<!--@hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 multiple identity tracking , found a hemifield advantage: " Contrary to expectations, a bilateral advantage was still observed, though it was not as strong as when observers were not required to remember the identities of the targets. This finding is inconsistent with the only model of multiple identity tracking (Oksama & Hyönä, 2008, Cognitive Psychology, 56, 237-283), so we present an alternative account."-->

<!--Tracking is important for representing objects still in view @tsubomiNeuralLimitsRepresenting2013-->



<!--
A second factor is that even when objects remain close enough to central vision to resolve their identities, a limited resource is required to bind their features together, including binding individual features with their location... 

A third factor is, of course, the limitations that result in imperfect performance even on tracking identical objects, reviewed in the previous sections..

You can track four objects without being able to identify stuff on the four objects. This could either be explained by attention needing to switch between locations, or alternatively that you just need less resource to track than to identify.

Because binding seems to require sustained attention, it’s unlikely it’s bound when serial attention isn’t there. But you might have a memory index of what is there - I need help on this from VWM people!-->


<!-- ## Configurations and 

Most models of tracking have assumed that people track only the targets, and track them without reference to the positions of any other objects. We know from other areas of research, however, that people rapidly extract that spatial layout or configuration of the objects in a scene. Some research has indicated that configural information is also used for tracking.

In sport, however, sometimes we are suprised to discover an opponent in the right place at the right time. "Where did he come from?" is a common complaint. This phenomenon can be partially understood in terms of the limit on the number of objects that can be tracked in MOT. It turns out, however, that this is only part of the story. The limitations on tracking are more profound than those we have reviewed so far.

The tracking research we have discussed so far has used targets and distractors that are all identical to each other (after the initial phase where the targets are indicated). In the real world, however, this is uncommon.

Visual short-term memory tasks typically find that people can perform reasonably well at storing at least four objects, allowing participants to detect whether an object changes during a short interval. This, together with the misconception discussed in section \@ref(bottlenecks) that tracking has a limit of four targets has led many researchers to suggest that a common limitation underlies both visual short-term memory and object tracking. This may be true in some sense, but certain possibilities have been ruled out by a dramatic finding.

<!--Putting objects in motion can dissociate tracking and short-term memory capacities. @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 asked participants to track four colored discs that periodically moved behind occluders and then re-appeared on the other side. There were no distractors. The task of participants was to detect whether any discs changed color. Contrary to what would be expected from object files theory [@kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992], for all but very slow speeds, performance was very low. However, because distractors were not included, there was no direct comparison to performance tracking solely the objects' locations (without knowing their colors). -->

# Abilities and individual differences {#abilities}

There are two basic approaches to understanding the abilities that underlie multiple object tracking. One is the classic experimental approach of dissociating the processes involved by manipulating different factors within participants. This has been the dominant approach and has led to our present understanding of the roles of spatial interference, temporal interference, and the duration that one can sustain attention. However, a small but growing literature has used the complementary individual-differences approach. In the individual-differences approach, the pattern of variation in scores on multiple tests is examined to see which abilities tend to go together. Those abilities that co-vary the most are thought to likely share more processes in common than those that don't.

## Do people vary much in how many objects they can track?

There are two very common pitfalls of individual-difference studies in this literature. These are in addition to the common mistake across all study types of not testing enough participants to have good statistical power - individual-difference studies can require more than ten times as many participants as a within-participants experimental design investigating a large effect [@schonbrodtWhatSampleSize2013]. 

@meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 tested fifty participants and for each one calculated the effective number of items tracked, for a display with four targets and four distractors, the modal effective number of items tracked was around two, but a substantial proportion of participants came in at three targets or one target tracked, and a few scored close to zero items tracked. It is tempting to conclude, as @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 did, that some participants could only track one or zero targets, while others can track more. Unfortunately, in the data of @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020, like that of many others, there is no way to know how much of the variation between individuals is due to motivation rather than ability. Measuring motivation reliably is difficult or impossible, so this is not something that can easily be remedied. But researchers can include what are sometimes called attention checks or catch trials to allow exclusion of participants who show clear evidence of not reading the instructions carefully or frequently not paying attention. <!--also, they can design their study to look at the pattern of correlations--> This is the first pitfall, failing to include some sort of measure that checks whether each participant is blowing off the task.

@oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 were also interested in how many objects people can track with reasonable accuracy. They made the effort to test 201 participants, and like @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 they found what appeared to be a substantial variation in capacity, with some people able to track six objects, while many could track only two or even just one. However, no analyses were reported regarding the reliability of the MOT test. Their participants, who were provided by an air pilot recruitment program, were made up entirely of those who scored in the top 11% on intelligence test scores from a larger group. This provides some confidence that the participants were motivated, although it is not clear that the intelligence tests were administered in the same session, so one cannot know whether the participants were motivated during this particular session. 

While we can be fairly confident that @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 used motivated paticipants, the study suffers from what I refer to as the second pitfall - the failure to assess task reliability. On any test, a participant will tend to get somewhat different scores when tested on two different occasions, even if they did not learn anything from their first experience with the test. The extent to which participants' scores are similar when taking a test twice is known as test-retest reliability. Ideally, this is measured with two tests administered at very different times, but a more limited measure is provided by dividing a single session's trials into two groups and calculating the correlation between those two groups, which is known as split-half reliability. Knowing the reliability can allow us to calculate how much of the variation in scores between participants is expected based on the noisiness of the test. Without knowing the reliability, there remains the possibility that the extreme variation in scores, with some participants' data indicating that they could only track one target, could be due to limited reliability - extensive testing of these participants might reveal that their low score was merely a fluke. 

Subsequent studies, fortunately, have assessed reliability, albeit only with the split-half measure rather than on separate days. Still, the reliabilities they have found for MOT are extremely impressive - 0.96 [@huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012], 0.85 [@wilbiksIndividualDifferencesMultiple2020], 0.92 [@trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021], and 0.87 [@eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018]. Most other attentional and cognitive tasks have lower reliablities, indeed many basic cognitive and attentional tasks have notoriously low reliabilities [@hedgeReliabilityParadoxWhy2018], and indeed, in these papers, MOT consistently scored near the top of the tests administered. Tasks with low reliabilities are not well suited for  individual-differences studies - as mentioned above, individual-difference studies are largely based on measuring the pattern of correlations between tasks to reveal the relationship among abilities. The lower the reliability of a task, the harder it is to reliably measure the correlation with another task.  

What do these high reliabilities mean for tracking? It suggests that the large individual differences observed by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 and others are actually real. It seems that some young, healthy, high-intelligence people can only track one target. Second, it means that individual-difference studies should be an excellent avenue for gaining new insights about tracking and its relation to other mental abilities.

Ageing is likely a major source of individual differences, as older participants perform much worse than younger participants [@trickAgerelatedDifferencesMultipleobject2005; @sekulerAgerelatedChangesAttentional2008; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017]. Using a task requiring participants to detect which of multiple objects had changed its trajectory, @kennedyEarlyAgerelatedDecline2009 found a steep decline between 30 and 60 years, where the effective numbers of tracked trajectories during Tripathy's multiple trajectory tracking task dropped by about 20% with each decade of aging, which could not be explained by a drop in visual acuity. This is interesting in itself, and is something that theories of aging and attention ought to explain, but I can't say more as I know very little about aging. This result must also color our interpretation of individual-difference studies using samples with a wide age range — some of the correlations with other tasks will likely be due to those abilities declining together rather than them being linked in people of the same age. That's still useful for drawing inferences, but slightly different inferences.

Researchers have taken what one might call a wide-angle approach to MOT individual difference studies. They've tested participants with a wide variety of tests, to see which mental abilities are linked. However, the first large-scale study concentrated on tasks typicaly thought of as attentional [@huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012]. Liqiang Huang and his colleagues used tests tof conjunction search, configuration search, counting, feature access, spatial pattern, response selection, visual short-term memory, change blindness, Raven's test of intelligence, visual marking, attentional capture, consonance-driven orienting, inhibition of return, task switching, mental rotation, and Stroop. Administered to a sample of Chinese university students (age not reported, but presumably mostly young adults), many of these tasks showed high reliabilities of over 0.9, meaning that there was a potential for high inter-task correlations (inter-task correlations are limited by the reliabilities of the two tasks involved). However, the highest correlation of a task with MOT was 0.4. The task was counting, which required judging whether the number of dots in a brief (400 ms) display were odd or even. Change blindness, feature access, visual working memory, and visual marking were runner ups with correlations of around 0.3. 
<!-- @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 "For each variable, reliability was estimated by calculating the split-half (odd-even) correlations and the Spearman-Brown formula was used for adjustment. All of the 17 paradigms met the minimum reliability of 0.7."  So I guess these are not raw correlations he reports from then on -->

That no task had a higher correlation is very interesting, but also disappointing. It's interesting because it suggests that MOT involves distinct abilities from several other tasks that on various grounds have been lumped together with MOT as all being "attentional". This is disappointing first because it suggests that our theoretical understanding of these tasks is sorely lacking. It's also disappointing because the low correlations mean that it's hard to discern the pattern of correlations, e.g. from most correlated to least correlated with MOT - when the highest correlations is 0.4, one needs very narrow confidence intervals to be confident of the ordering of the tasks.
<!--, although another possibility is that the way people are different from each other has little to do with the--> 

@trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 reported data from more than 400 participants tested online, an opportunity sample with a very wide range of ages, from 18 to 89. They tested a set of cognitive, attentional, and common neuropsychological tasks: arithmetic word problems, the trial-making task, digit span, digit symbol coding, letter cancellation, spatial span, approximate number sense, flanker interference, gradual onset continuous performance, spatial configuration visual search, and visual working memory as well as MOT. MOT had among the highest reliabilities, at 0.92. MOT performance had  little correlation with performance on the task designed to measure sustained attention over an extended period (about five minutes, the gradual-onset continual performance task [@fortenbaughSustainedAttentionLife2015]. This supports the tentative conclusion, already suggested in Chapter \@ref(whichAspects), that the ability to sustain attention without lapses is not an important determinant of tracking performance (as was ).

In the @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 inventory, the task that most resembled the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012, which @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 found had a high correlation with MOT, was the approximate number sense task, with a moderate correlation of 0.3. It differed from the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 by not testing the subitizing (less than 5 items) range, which might help explain any discrepancy. In a more limited study, @eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018 found, using hierarchical regression, that subitizing made a contribution to predicting MOT performance that was somewhat separate to that of an estimation task using larger set sizes. <!-- change blindness, load-induced blindness and multiple object tracking, MOT split-half reliability of .87 -->

The tasks with the highest correlations with MOT in the data of @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 were visual working memory, spatial span, letter cancellation, and digit symbol coding, all at around 0.5. As the authors pointed out, the letter cancellation and digit symbol coding tasks are complex tasks developed in neuropsychology that are believed to reflect a number of abilities. This makes it hard to interpret their correlation with MOT. Spatial span and visual working memory are quite different from MOT, but similar to each other in that they both involve short-term memory for multiple visual stimuli.

Overall, there is a reasonable level of agreement across these individual-differences studies, as well as others not described here, such as @trickSpatialVisuospatialWorking2012. They agree that visual working memory has a robust correlation with MOT performance, which is particularly interesting because superficially, MOT imposes little to no memory demand. Most researchers conceive of tracking as involving allocating multifocal attention to multiple targets simultaneously, with a process autonomous to memory causing the foci of attention to move along with the moving targets.

From the consistently strong correlation of MOT performance with visual working memory, it is tempting to conclude that mechanistically the two tasks are tightly linked. However, it must be remembered that working memory tasks are among the best predictors of a wide range of tasks, including intelligence as well as the Stroop task, spatial cuing, and task switching [e.g. @redickWorkingMemoryCapacity2006].

## Going deeper

Variation in multiple object tracking is unlikely to be caused by just one ability. Thanks to three decades of work, we now understand that tracking performance can be limited by spatial interference and temporal interference, as well as less task-specific factors such as lapses of attention. And there may be other abilities that substantially contribute.

Unfortunately, no individual difference study to date seems to have attempted to partial out the possible components of MOT (e.g., spatial interference versus temporal interference) to see whether they show different patterns of correlations with other tasks. In the realm of spatial interference with static stimuli, even studies with small sample sizes have revealed substantial individual differences [@petrovAsymmetriesIdiosyncraticHot2011], such as larger crowding zones in some types of dyslexia [@jooOptimizingTextIndividual2018]. These differences may form a large part of inter-individual differences in MOT. There is also evidence that training with action video games can reduce spatial interference and improve reading ability [@bertoniExcessiveVisualCrowding2019], making it especially important to investigate spatial interference further.

With the growth of online testing, however, the sample sizes required for individual difference studies have become easier to obtain, and so individual differences are a promising future direction. However, researchers who are more familiar with the issues and analyses of within-subjects studies must be aware of the different issues that are important for individual-differences studies.

<!--In Huang et al.’s study, the correlation between MOT and VWM was .30, the correlation between (configuration) search and MOT was .30, and the correlation between search and VWM was .23. In our data, however, MOT and VWM were much more closely correlated with each other (.51)-->

# Towards the real world

Some of the findings in multiple object tracking, and visual attention more generally, are useful for informing how non-scientists should think about real-world situations. A naive view of visual perception and attention is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene. Many sports coaches may unfortunately believe this, thinking that unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone in front of us on the basketball court, or the soccer field, is at all times. Similarly, during driving many people seem to assume that they are aware of all hazards in their visual field. The fact that this is not accurate has been incorporated into driver education [@fisherCanNoviceDrivers2006].

The limitations of drivers in apprehending upcoming hazards, and lack of awareness of other players in the visual field in sportspeople, are often described in classes as being related to change blindness, which no doubt they are, but the limitations on multiple object tracking almost certainly contribute to them. When an object is being actively attended, which in a moving scene means tracked, change blindness or lack of knowledge of the object's identity is somewhat less likely. This was supported in a study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014 involving a driving simulator, who found that changes were found more accurately and rapidly when the change was made to a target vehicle rather than a distractor vehicle. The poor maintenance of non-spatial featural information during tracking (described in chapter \@ref(identity)) also should inform our approach to real-world situations.

Few empirical studies, unfortunately, have made strong links between real-world situations nad laboratory MOT tasks, or its underlying abilities. @bowersCanWeImprove2013 found that laboratory MOT performance did not predict driving test performance as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment task, a trail-making task, or a subtest of a useful field-of-view task. The aforementioned driving simulator study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014 found that drivers were more accurate at localizing which of multiple lead vehicles braked if it was a tracking target, but there was no advantage in terms of braking response time. 

@mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 used a multiple object avoidance task where the user used a mouse to control one of the balls that they had to prevent from colliding with the other balls. The task is reminiscent of the old Asteroids game mentioned in the beginning of this book. @mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 found strong correlations with performance on a driving simulator and with years of driving experience. In an earlier paper, some of these authors found that the MOA correlated better with driving performance than conventional MOT [@mackenzieLinkAttentionalFunction2017]. 

In sports, some teams of researchers have frequently suggested that MOT performance predicts in-game performance in soccer and other sports, and further reported evidence that training on MOT tasks can enhance skill in sports. Unfortunately, the associated evidence is not strong [@vaterCriticalSystematicReview2021]. Given the poor record of computer-based training tasks (sometimes called "brain training") in improving skills in other real-world domains, one should remain skeptical that MOT training has benefits until rigorous evidence is provided [@simonsBraintrainingProgramsWork2016].

# Progress and recommendations #recommendations

The study of multiple object tracking has traditionally been done in the laboratory exercise with only a few dozen participants in an experiment. Only recently, then, has one of the greatest virtues of the MOT task become clear: it's high test-retest reliability, of approximately .8 or .9, among the highest among attentional tasks and far higher than many common laboratory tasks (see chapter \@ref(abilities)). The outlook for future work, then, is very positive both from the prospect of new results being credible (because with a non-noisy task, less data is needed to have high statistical power) and for the use of MOT as a tool to study other things, such as individual differences.

To further highlight how much we have learned, next I will describe how much findings have allowed us to disconfirm multiple aspects of the first and most influential theory of tracking. 

<!--
Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.

Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance. -->

## The decline of Pylyshyn's FINST theory

At the time of writing, Pylyshyn's FINST theory described in the very first paper on MOT is the featured theory on the "multiple object tracking" Wikipedia page [@wikipediaeditorsMultipleObjectTracking2021], and it is frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well. However, some of the main features of the theory have been rebutted [@schollWhatHaveWe2008].

Core to the theory is the idea that tracking is mediated by a fixed set of discrete, preattentive indices. As we have seen, however, as speed increases, the number of targets that can be tracked rapidly decreases, to one target, which is hard to explain with a fixed set of discrete indices [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012].

Adding to the evidence that tracking draws on attentional resources are dual-task studies. I did not have space to review them in this book, but they indicate that tracking draws on attentional resources shared with some other tasks, and pupil data  [@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014]. One should add, however, that such studies do not seem to have ruled out the possibility that these findings were caused entirely by a C=1 resource rather than the hemifield-specific tracking processes; unfortunately, none of these studies appear to have tested for the hemifield specificity of their findings.

An important prediction of Pylyshyn's theory was also that participants should be aware which target is which among the targets they are tracking. Pylyshyn himself found strong evidence against this. Again, I have focused on the evidence against Pylyshyn's theory to showcase that the literature has come a long way in thirty-four years. This is also worth emphasizing because we share a problem of many other literatures, that large numbers of researchers know something about tracking but can be way out of date on theory and recent findings.

<!--Although CDA findings suggest there is something tracking number of objects rather than resources expended @drewVogel @balabanObjectRepresentationsVisual2016, I don't know that it supports a limit on this -->

A salient case of more mixed progress is that while early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992], this recently has been questioned, and now is a favored account of tracking in some circumstances, as reviewed in Chapter \@ref(serialOrParallel).

## Topics not covered by this book

Many topics were not covered in this book (I was given a word limit by the publisher). Some of the most important are whether tracking operates in a retinotopic, spatiotopic, or configural representation (see [@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992; @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020; @howeCoordinateSystemsUsed2010; @meyerhoffDistractorLocationsInfluence2015b; @liuMultipleObjectTrackingBased2005; @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021]), the role of distractors and possible distractor suppression, the role of surface features [@papenmeierTrackingLocationFeatures2014], and the literature on dual-task paradigms, although a few such papers were mentioned along the way [e.g., @alvarezMultielementVisualTracking2005].

<!--
## Dual-task OUT OF SCOPE

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

The dual-task literature is very large. Can't review it all here

Alvarez, G.A., et al., Are mutielement visual tracking and visual search mutually exclusive? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2005. 31(4): p. 643-667.

There seems to be an especially close link between MOT and subitizing
@trickAgeDifferencesEnumerating2003 observed that even very slow motion reduced
enumeration speed for stimuli containing 6–9 items, while
the enumeration of 1–4 items was not affected when items
were in motion. Similarly, @alstonSubitizationAttentionalEngagement2004
presented static and moving items, finding that faster and
more accurate enumeration occurred in the subitizing range
given the presence of moving items.

psilocybin seems to impair MOT but not visual working memory [@carterUsingPsilocybinInvestigate2005] 

Subitizing no bilateral advantage on accuracy, but that could be due to very high accuracy - when looking at response time, an advantage is found, although not clear it's as large as that for MOT @railoBilateralTwoitemAdvantage2014

"The results indicated that the number of items participants could subitize decreased by one for each item they tracked." @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011

 "concurrent performance of a MOT task and a VWM task still instilled substantial and load-dependent dual-task costs. " @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006

@allenMultipletargetTrackingRole2006

object tracking in people with Williams Syndrome remains at the level of 4‐year‐olds, whereas the ability to remember multiple locations of static objects develops further. @ohearnDevelopmentalProfilesMultiple2010 

@howardVisualSpatialAttention2020 "for a purely spatial task, perceptual attention (TRACKING?) and working memory appear to recruit separate core capacity-limited processes."

@souzaContributionsVisualCentral2017 argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources." "Distracting visual attention, but not central attention, impaired MOT performance"
-->


## Recommendations

Here are a few recommendations for multiple object tracking researchers that have emerged from this journey through the literature:

* To dilute the influence of C=1 processes, use several targets, not just two or three. But remember that even with several targets, a small effect could be explained by a  C=1 process, so consider that. Test for hemifield specificity as that can also rule out C=1 processes.

* Always test for hemifield specificity. In addition to it helping to rule out a factor having its effect only on C=1 processes, we know very little about what limited-resource processes are hemisphere-specific, so any results here are likely to be interesting.

<!--The effect increases with retention interval, and may be a more cognitive mechanism, as it has been suggested that  Rep- resentational momentum occurs in memory for implied motion stimuli and  neither of which elicits pursuit eye movements.-->

* For computational modelling, I don't recommend modelling only data from standard, fairly unconstrained trajectories, as such data may not constrain models enough. Show your model successfully mimics both spatial crowding and temporal interference effects, including that temporal interference is more resource-intensive than spatial interference. Another strategy is to model large sets of data at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from only one or a few different MOT experiments.

<!--Two strategies to improve the constraints on models present themselves. One is to fix the individual components of the models based on the results of experiments designed to isolate those component, such as the experiments by [@verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017] for identifying temporal limits and that of @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 to identify the range of spatial crowding. Another strategy is to model much larger sets of data, at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from at most two different MOT experiments.

Study change detection during motion.-->
