# Attending to moving objects

<!-- What can a shell game tell us about perception?
-->

Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.

## Tracking task short description and anecdotes

On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles. In conference halls, scientists monitor the position and posture of other researchers relative to the ones they are chatting to, in order to best time their approach. At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water. On the sports field, players often find themselves trying to keep track of multiple team-mates and opponents and their spatial relationships to the ball.

shell game

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?

Until the late 1980s, almost no-one who studied attention used moving objects. Partly this was a technology issue, even though in 1979, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced Asteroids.

```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"), results = 'asis', echo = F}

```

The task was to shoot and dodge the asteroids that are streaming in all directions. It pays to monitor more than one of the moving objects, to determine which way one should move, or shoot, to prevent a collision. Psychologists were slow to use the associated technology to study how people processed multiple moving objects. Finally, in 1988, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 used an Apple II+ computer to conduct an experiment that demonstrated that people could keep track of multiple moving objects. Pylyshyn & Storm showed that people can keep track of multiple moving objects designated as targets in a crowd of identical distractors.

It was immediately apparent that the ability to track had a rather dramatic capacity limitation. That is, performance dropped quite rapidly as the number of targets was increased.

For the particular object trajectories and speeds used by some researchers
@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988, performance dropped rapidly


This ability was also immediately observed to have a severe capacity limit. 

Researchers quickly latched onto the word "attentional" to describe this ability, 
in part because various 

Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.

Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding

The manuscript would start with a few anecdotes illustrating why keeping track of objects is important both today (e.g., keeping track of one's children at the beach, keeping track of particular players on the sports field<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move -->) and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey). Then it would transition into some basic background about the visual system. Descriptions of the the draft sections are below. These section descriptions showcase that multiple, typically separate literatures would be integrated.

## Outline

**Intro** 

**Bottlenecks** 

**Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance?**

1. C=1 processes
1. Duration one can sustain attention
1. Spatial selection of multiple locations, even static ones
1. Spatial interference
1. Temporal interference
1. Speed limit of attention-following

Each of these could hinder performance more with more targets. They contribute in an unknown mix to most trakcing tasks .
Thus we don't know which is responsible for various results. This has afflicted the quest to understand serialOrParallel, 


<!-- **Different resources for different tasks** The brain can do some tasks with remarkably little interference between them, while others are  -->

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.

**Serial processing, parallel processing, or both?** The way that our limited capacities are allocated over time to multiple objects, that is whether in parallel or in rapid series, has been a long debate. Recent evidence (including one of my papers) points to a serial component that seems to relate to natural oscillations in the brain, but much is yet to be determined.

# Bottlenecks and capacity {#bottlenecks}

Consider a simple problem in arithmetic. What is fourteen times eight? I am sure you can calculate that product, but it might take you a few seconds to do so. And if I set you two problems rather than just one, for example I asked you to also divide sixty-eight by seventeen, you would do the two problems one at a time. Indeed, our minds may be completely incapable of doing two such problems simultaneously [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002; @zylberbergBrainRouterCortical2010a].

Such limitations are somewhat remarkable given that each of our brains contains more than 80 billion neurons. In particular, our  profound limitations speak to the importance of the architecture of the mind, in particular its bottlenecks, to understanding our abilities.

Of course, multiplying and dividing two-digit numbers are not something that most of us do every day. A task we do have daily practice with, however, is reading. Yet despite the years of practice, a large body of psychological research suggests that humans can read at most only a few words at a time, and much researcher further indicates that we can only read *one* word at a time [@whiteEvidenceSerialProcessing2018; @reichleEncodingMultipleWords2009]. It seems, then, that at least some of the bottlenecks of human information processing are a fixed property of our processing architecture.

In this context, the term 'bottleneck' makes sense if one imagines a standard 2 liter soft drink bottle. Most of the volume of the soft drink is in the wide part of the bottle, which if held upside-down presses down on the narrow neck, which when the bottle is opened restricts the rate at which the liquid exits the bottle. As a metaphor for the mind, a large volume of signals from across the visual field press up against more limited-capacity brain areas. The large volume of visual signals is crated by the large array of neurons that we have in the retina and a few subsequent areas that process signals in parallel.

The parallel processing prior to the bottlenecks is sufficient to get certain tasks done. In the below display, for example, you should be able to find the blue objects very quickly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.height = 2.0, fig.width=2.5}
#bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png ?
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
pts<- expand.grid(x = seq(2,16,2), y = seq(2,16,2), type = c("distractor"))
jittr<-.4
pts$x <- pts$x + runif(length(pts$x))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$y <- pts$y + runif(length(pts$y))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$type <- as.character(pts$type)
pts$type[c(1,4,6,8,11,12,13,16,20,25,26,30,33,37,41,44,47,48,52,55,59,60)] <- "distractor2"
pts$type[c(13,26,46)] <- "target"

ymin<-600; ymax<-2000
ggplot(pts,aes(x=x,y=y, color=type)) + geom_point(size=6)  +  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "none")
#+ ylim(ymin,ymax)
```

Our visual system processes each of the shapes simultaneously, which can make the locations of the blue objects available very rapidly when you choose to attend to blue. Some brain areas, however, do not have neurons that can recognize objects dedicated to each bit of the visual field. Instead, their simultaneous processing capacity is limited. The processes required to recognize words are one example.

For a limited capacity process such as word recognition to do its job, something is needed to pick out, from a crowded scene, just one or a few objects for these processes to recognize. This something is often referred to as *selective attention*. <!--Different visual abilities seem to have different capacities, and it is not at all clear that a common selective attention process is responsible for gating all of their inputs.-->

While word recognition may only be able to process one word at a time, and some visual searches reflect processing that can be described as massively parallel, other processing falls somewhere in between. That is, the processes underlying some of our abilities are limited in capacity, but not as limited as word recognition seems to be. As we will see, object tracking is a case in point.

One or two myths about object tracking have become fairly widespread, and one of them relates to the nature of tracking's capacity limit, so before delving deeper into that issue, in the next section I will first address that myth. 

<!--CROSS-CHECK WITH PSYC2016 TEXT
@duncanSelectiveAttentionOrganization1984 was interested in how many objects we can process at a time. He found that accuracy for making a simple visual judgment about an object was much worse when one needed to simultaneously make a judgment about another. For example, participants were asked to judge whether a briefly-presented rectangle was small or large and also judge whether a simultaneously presented line was dotted or dashed. Performance was worse FOR the two-object condition even in comparison to a single-object condition where two judgments also needed to be made. The participants had to make either two judgments about a single object or one judgment about one object and the second judgment about a different object. To Duncan, his finding that performance was substantially worse in the two-object condition indicated the existence of a bottleneck at a stage that processes objects. He wrote that 

> Findings support a view in which parallel, preattentive processes serve to segment the field into separate objects, followed by a process of focal attention that deals with only one object at a time.

This conclusion was an over-reach. Performance was better than one would expect if only one object were processed, unlike what has been found for word processing. Duncan could explain that by saying that the presentation time was adequate for focal attention to, on *some* trials, process more than one object. Alternatively, however, it may be that the relevant processes *can* handle two objects at a time, but they do so more poorly than for one object. Work that credibly claims that a visual ability is truly limited to one object at a time is hard to find; the reading of words may be an exception.-->

# The biggest myth of object tracking {#biggestMyth}

According to many papers in the psychological literature, people can only track four or five objects. @doranRoleVisualAttention2010, for example, claim that "the main finding" from the object tracking literature "is that observers can accurately track approximately four objects and that once this limit is exceeded, accuracy declines precipitously." Similarly, writing about the "object tracking system", @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 wrote that "One of the defining properties of this system is that it is limited in capacity to three to four individuals at a time".

This biggest myth about tracking is actually two claims. The first is that there is a constant limit of around four objects. The second is that, regardless of whether the limit varies across circumstances, accuracy declines precipitously [@doranRoleVisualAttention2010] when the limit is reached.

I have examined the references cited by several papers that might reasonably be taken to be claiming a version of either the first or second claims. Unfortunately, typically authors do not distinguish between these two claims, instead they make a vague statement that might be taken to refer to either or to both. Accordingly, vague statements had to be included in my search, in particular the following published statements:
"People’s ability to attentively track a number of randomly moving objects among like distractors is limited to four or five items"  <!--cites Pylyshyn Storm 1989--> [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006],  <!-- which cites Scholl's objects paper which makes the claim of 4 FINSTs but backs it up only with STM etc. type studies -->, "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked"  @alvarezHowManyObjects2007, "people typically can track four or five items" @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011 <!--cites Pylyshyn 1989-->, "participants can track about four objects simultaneously" @vanderburgChangesNotDifferences2019 <!-- (see Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005, for a review; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988)-->. In each of these cases, I have checked the evidence provided, or the papers cited, as well as the papers those papers cite. Each paper  provides no evidence supporting the claim that performance decreases very rapidly once the number of targets is increased above some value. Those that do have evidence that is relevant find only a gradual decrease in performance as number of targets is increased with no discontinuity, nor even a conspicuous inflection point. For example, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 designated between two and six objects as targets, among twelve identical objects in total. After the objects moved around randomly for five seconds, one object was flashed repeatedly and participants hit a key to indicate whether they thought it was one of the targets. The proportion of trials in which participants were wrong increased steadily with target size, from 3% incorrect with two targets, to 16% incorrect with six targets. Note that even with six targets, participants were performing substantially better than would be expected if they could only track one or two and had to guess on the others.

Even @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988, the paper most frequently invoked when a limit of four objects is claimed, found a quite gradual decrease in performance (their Figure 1) as the number of targets was increased from one to five, and five was the most targets that they tested. In their paper, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 do not suggest that there is a hard or precipitous limit, but in 1994, @pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994 did write that it is "possible to track about four randomly moving objects", even though earlier in that paper they contradict this somewhat by writing "at least four". I suspect that some cases of this sort of slide toward backing a consistent and hard limit reflects a desire for a simple story. It may also stem from an unconscious oversimplification of one's own data, as well as the theoretical framing by @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 that tracking was limited by a set of discrete mental pointers.

Recall that the myth is associated with two claims, not just that there is a "limit" after which performance decreases rapidly, but also that this limit is consistently found to be about four. Because the published evidence indicates that the first claim is incorrect, let's put that aside and consider the claim that tracking performance falls, even if not rapidly, to some particular level, such as 75% correct, at about four targets. Or instead of a percent correct criterion, alternatively the criterion could be something like the halfway point from ceiling to chance performance, or the "effective number of items tracked" [@schollWhatVisualObject2001] calculated by applying a formula to percent correct together with the number of targets and distractors.

Several early studies can perhaps reasonably be described as finding that a similar number of objects can be tracked before accuracy falls by much. <!-- Alvarez & Franconeri (2007)  "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992). The similarity of these estimates, combined with the frequency with which 4-item limits arise in other attention tasks, suggests the possibility that there is a “magical number 4” in visual attention (Cowan, 2001; Pylyshyn, 1989)."  neither said any such thing, it seems from my reading of those papers, e.g.  Pylyshyn & Storm 1988 only went up to 5 out of 10 and there was gradual decrease in performance all the way through. --> <!-- Papers I have checked for the 4-object claim: Cowan, 2001 claimed it for MOT, citing Pylyshyn et al. 1994, which does say "experiments showing that observers can simultaneously track some three to five identical target items" but then when he describes the studies he doesn't say they show that, even though in the discussion he says "One is that it is possible to track about four randomly moving objects" -->
<!-- In some cases the problem stems from Scholl Pylyshyn Feldman paper that devised the effective tracking capacity measure assuming 100% accuracy for one object and delivering a single number, often 4, for effective number tracked--> However, work published during this century revealed this to be an artifact of researchers using similar display and task characteristics. One of the most salient of these characteristics is object speed.

@alvarezHowManyObjects2007 used a display of sixteen circles that wandered about the screen, and found that the fewer in number were the targets to track, the faster participants could track them. Conversely, at very high speeds, participants could only track one object with reasonable accuracy. The finding that participants can track at least four objects with reasonable accuracy is restricted to particular object speeds was also found by others [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012] and it was also found that the number that can be tracked depends on the objects' spacing [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008; @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. As we will be discussed extensively in section \@ref(twoBrains), it also can depend greatly on whether the targets are distributed between the left and right hemifields or instead are confined to one hemifield.

In summary, it is wrong to say that people can track about four moving objects or that once some number of targets is reached, performance declines very rapidly. It is also wrong to say that people can track "about four objects". The number that can be tracked is quite specific to the display arrangement, object spacing, and object speeds. Nevertheless, something like the limit-of-four statement can be made true if it stipulated certain tasks, display characteristics, and performance measures.

In 2013, a diverse set of two dozen working memory researchers attended a workshop with the purpose of "developing benchmarks for models of working memory". They grappled with, among other issues, how to characterize the limit on how many items people can remember. In their paper that ultimately resulted from the workshop, the researchers pointed out that "observed item limits vary substantially between materials and testing procedures" [@oberauerBenchmarksModelsShortterm2018]. Nevertheless, they suggested that much of this variability could be explained by humans' ability to store groups of items as "chunks" and thus they endorsed a statement that there is a limit of "three to four chunks" [@cowanMagicalNumberShortterm2001a]. Hence, these researchers believed they could explain the observed variability in experiments' results by a common underlying limit of three to four chunks that manifests as different observed item limits depending on circumstances, in particular opportunity for chunking.

In the case of MOT, possibly researchers can identify a set of circumstances that consistently yield a mean tracking limit of three or four targets (if "limit" is  defined as performance falling to a particular level on some performance metric). Perhaps these circumstances will simply be certain spacings, speeds, object trajectories, and number of objects in a display. Ideally, however, some underlying construct (the counterpart of chunks for memory) would be identified to explain how performance changes when other circumstances are used. That would constitute real progress in theory development.

<!-- At this point,  to defend the claim that people can track "about four objects" is to suggest that the studies that have found four targets to be the number that can be tracked . Is there something special about  these speeds. Nobodh justified them with ecological analysis-->

## Different tasks, same limit?

While it is not correct to say that people can track about four objects, there is an important related claim that has more support. This is frequently wrapped up in the myth, for example phrased as the idea of a "magical number four", but referring to the notion that very different tasks have the same limit. For example, @bettencourtSharedFilteringProcesses2011 write that "both processes [visual short-term memory and MOT] showing an equivalent four-object limit", and @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 similarly claimed that visuo-spatial short-term memory, ultra-rapid counting (subitizing), and multiple object tracking all share a limit of "three or four items".

The literature on subitizing, sometimes known as numerosity perception, has a very long history of claiming that accuracy in counting the objects in a brief exposure has a real limit of about four objects - in the sense of a sudden decrease in accuracy when the number of objects shown goes from less than four to more than four [@jevonsPowerNumericalDiscrimination1871; @revkinDoesSubitizingReflect2008]. In the "subitizing range" of four or fewer objects, performance is approximately as good for rapidly counting four objects as it is for two or one. It seems this proposition is well-supported; while some have questioned it [@dehaeneDevelopmentElementaryNumerical1993], additional evidence has accumulated for a truly distinct subitizing range [@revkinDoesSubitizingReflect2008a]. It has often been also claimed that there is a limit of about four objects that can be stored in visual working memory [e.g., @cowanMagicalMysteryFour2010]. Whether there is a discontinuity after four objects or at any point remains highly debated, however [e.g. @robinsonThereCapacityAssessing2020].

At the level of a common limit in terms of number, then, it remains unclear whether tasks such as object tracking, visual working memory, and subitizing can be said to have a common limit. Ideally this could be confirmed by measuring the limits for all three tasks using the same stimuli, but it is unclear how to equate difficulty across tasks. Especially difficult is comparing performance with the briefly-presented static stimuli used in subitizing and working memory tasks to the extended exposures of moving stimuli needed to assess object tracking. A modeling approach could make progress on this issue, although it would require making assumptions that might need novel empirical support. Another approach is to determine which tasks' limits co-vary between individuals. This is reviewed in section \@ref(abilities).

<!-- https://psyc2016.whatanimalssee.com/bottlenecks.html#a-bottleneck-for-object-judgments -->

<!--Working off the dominant framing, that each person does have a specific number of targets they can track which determines percent correct for each level of number of targets, some MOT researchers report what @schollWhatVisualObject2001 called the "effective number of items tracked". The associated formula, refined by @hullemanMathematicsMultipleObject2005a allows researchers to calculate the effective number of items tracked based on accuracy in an individual condition, given the number of targets and distractors in that condition. This does provide a useful summary of the data, but researchers should take more care to avoid taking it literally.--> <!--Still, it does seem that the number four pops up more than would be expected if these abilities were unrelated. -->

To summarize this section, there are three common misconceptions about what has been shown about object tracking. The one that we have just discussed is that different tasks show the same limit. This may well be true, but I know of no research that have used the same display and task settings to adequately back this up. Now returning to the previous section, it is not justified to say that as the number of targets is increased to about four, performance falls to a certain criterion level. One must specify particular display and task characteristics in order to make that statement true. A final misconception is that performance falls very rapidly when one increases the number of targets past a particular number (the "limit").

Given that tracking performance does depend greatly on circumstances and falls gradually rather than displaying a discontinuity at a particular target number, what are the implications for how tracking works? Briefly, these characteristics of tracking are particularly consistent with resource theories, which are discussed in section \@ref(whichAspects).

# Objects and attentional spread

A typical living room in an average person's house contains dozens of objects. As I sit here in mine, these objects reflect light from the window and into my retinas. The family dog, which had been napping, stands up on its four legs and leaves the room. He is headed for the kitchen. As he moved, I tracked him with my attention. To do so, something in my brain had to identify a particular set of neural activations as constituting an object. What sort of processing occurs to create these neural activations and treat them as a group?

This starts in the retina, of course, but the processing that occurs there is far from enough to segment a dog, or practically any other object, from a background. Processing in the thalamus and early visual cortex must continue the job, and much of it likely occurs regardless of where one is attending.

Exactly how extensive this "preattentive" processing is, and what sorts of representations it results in, has been studied for quite a long time [@neisserDecisionTimeReactionTimeExperiments1963; @treismanVerbalCuesLanguage1964]. The resulting object representations cannot all be processed by higher cognitive processes, not simultaneously anyway. 

then be selected by 

It is commonly thought that object representations

Attentive tracking is often conceptualized as a process wherein a limited resource selects one or more preattentively-created representations. This selection process than allows for continuous monitoring of that entity's changing position as well as other sorts of events, such as detection of probes flashed on the associated stimulus. In fact, it is unclear whether processing is so neatly divided, with preattentive representations merely selected rather than attention participating in modifying or even creating the representation that is tracked. With behavioral tasks, the most straightforward assessment that can be done is the end result of this processing. That is, which sorts of stimuli can be tracked and which cannot?

The first deployment of attention to a stimulus likely occurs more via a spatial or featural index than through an index of the objects in the scene. That is, we cannot think to ourselves "car" or "tree" and expect our attention to deploy directly to any cars or trees in the scene. In contrast, our ability to deploy attention to a cued *location* is well-established, as is our ability to deploy attention directly to certain other features, such as color or motion direction. That is, when people are instructed to think about a particular location in the visual field, this results very rapidly in facilitation of perceptual performance for that location, and neural activation in the associated parts of retinotopic cortices. There does not seem to be any "search" needed, instead spatial location seems to provide a direct conduit for attentional activation. Similarly, for certain features such as motion and color, an instruction to attend to a particular direction, or a particular color, triggers rapid activation across the visual field at all the locations of that particular color or motion [@saenzGlobalFeaturebasedAttention2003; @whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011].

As a result of this featural selection capability, if a moving target differs from distractors in certain ways, then featural selection can be relied on to keep attention on the target. For example, if the targets are the only yellow objects in the scene, and all the distractors are blue or green, then one can think "yellow" and that is enough to keep attention on the targets and off the distractors. It is when the targets are identical to the distractors, or not distinguishable from the distractors by one of the features that feature selection acts on, that a different process is needed. Something else has to be involved to keep attention on a moving target.

Success at tracking requires something other than selection of spatial locations. If spatial location selection were the only process operating, when an object moved, attention would be left behind. A striking characteristic of the experience of tracking is that the movement of attention along with an object can feel effortless. <!--Indeed, one might say that attention is being positively pulled along.--> When the targets in an MOT trial begin to move, I have never had the experience of my attention staying behind, remaining at one of the original target locations. Instead, I feel my attention following along with the objects, and even when I try, it feels unnatural to un-latch my attention from a target and fix it to the target's current location while the target moves on.

The term "object-based attention" is sometimes bandied about as an explanation of this. However, this makes some possibly-unwarranted assumptions. The idea is that the units of spatial selection are objects rather than locations [@pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006; @clarkLocationLocationLocation2009]. Now, no one seems to think that direct object *selection* is a thing, in the way that color selection is. That is, one cannot think "chair" and have the locations of chairs in the scene rapidly be attended. No, selection of chairs seems to require a search first, based on locations and simpler features. And even color selection may work via location, with thinking of a color resulting in availability of its locations, and attention then being deployed to those locations [@shihThereFeaturebasedAttentional1996a].

One account that fits this broader picture is that attention is deployed first to a location or locations, but any objects present cause or encourage spatial attention to spread throughout the object. Although researchers who study the relationship between attention and objects often are not explicit, this "attentional spread" theory seems to be a popular one in the literature. 

## Stationary objects and attentional spread

Dozens, if not hundrends, of published experiments have investigated the relationship of objects to attention in a cuing paradigm. Most such research has been based on @eglyShiftingVisualAttention1994a, who presented two static objects (rectangles) and presented a cue on one end of an object or another. This can result in a performance enhancement not only for probes at the cued of the object, but also at its other end, relative to equidistant locations on the second object. The findings reported in most published papers are that participants are fastest and most accurate when the stimulus is presented in the same location as the cue, or on the same object albeit on a different part of that object. 

You may have noticed that I described this finding as the result that is in "most published papers". I used that qualifier because this pattern is not always observed in the published literature [@davisReversalObjectBased2005; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionStrength2008; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionSensory2002; @louIndividualDifferencesTemporal2020], and one can anticipate that studies that did not find an advantage are likely to end up in the proverbial file drawer. The effect sizes in the literature are often quite small and the studies not highly powered, which can be a red flag that publication bias may have created the illusion of a real effect [@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013]. @francisExcessSuccessArticles2021 assessed the pattern of sample sizes, effect sizes, and p-values in three dozen published object-based attention studies and argue that it suggests that publication bias and/or p-hacking in the literature is rife. This is plausible, because substantial proportions of researchers in psychology and other fields admit to such practices [@johnMeasuringPrevalenceQuestionable2012; @rabeloQuestionableResearchPractices2020; @chinQuestionableResearchPractices2021]. @francisExcessSuccessArticles2021 further point out that the only previously-published study with a large sample (120 participants) found a non-significant effect of only a 6.5 ms difference in response time [@pilzHowPrevalentObjectBased2012], and in their own study with 264 participants, the effect was also quite small, at 14 ms. For an effect of this size, the sample sizes typically used in the published literature were unlikely to yield statistical significance without some help from p-hacking or another questionable research practice. As a result, the pattern of results in the literature that have led to various conclusions about objects and attention unfortunately cannot be trusted.

These issues many areas of the psychological literature. They are less of a problem when the effects being studied are large, because then studies are more likely to be adequately powered and there should be fewer false positives and false negatives. This is actually a big reason why I have spent a lot of time studying tracking. There are many large effects in the tracking literature. Some are so large that several seconds of looking at a display can be enough to convince oneself that the effect is real. Some results for tracking and objects are one such example, as we will see.

## The ends of objects

Many objects, such as the letter 'T', are comprised of parts that are quite salient. Normally you treat 'T' as a single object, but you can also see that it is made up of a horizontal segment as well as a vertical segment. In conscious awareness, then, we have access to both the whole object level and to an individual parts level. You are able to focus attention on individual bits of the vertical segment, even though there are no visual characteristics that differentiate it. Which of these levels of detail can our object tracking processes operate on?

In early visual cortex, rather separate populations of neurons respond to the the horizontal and vertical strokes of a 'T'. As will soon be clear from the evidence, however, having neurons that respond to a thing does not suffice to be able to track that thing. Only particular kinds of neural representations enable tracking.

@schollWhatVisualObject2001 shed light on this by asking participants to try to track the ends of lines. They presented participants with four lines and designated one end of each as a target. After the movement phase, at the end of the trial participants were to click with a mouse on the line ends that were targets. During a trial, each line grew, shrank, and rotated as each of its ends wandered about the screen randomly. 

![A schematic of the display used by Scholl et al. (2001)](imagesForRmd/linesSchollPylyshynFeldman_madeByHolcombe.png){width=40%}

The results were striking. Performance on the task was abysmal relative to a control condition in which the two ends of the line were not connected. The effect is large enough that simply by viewing an example trial, one very quickly gets a sense of how difficult the task is.

(ASK SCHOLL FOR THE MOVIE RIGHTS)

The task of tracking a line's end in the experiment of @schollWhatVisualObject2001 experiment was complicated by the fact that the objects frequently crossed over each other and also their length changed over time. Follow-up work by @howeCanAttentionBe2012, however, showed that these factors were not the main reason for the poor performance. It really does seem to be the case that one cannot confine one's tracking processes to one bit of an undifferentiated object. 

Our inability to track the ends of lines shouldn't be too surprising. Introspectively, maintaining attention on a part of the visual scene in the absence of much in the image to delineate that part feels like it requires concentration, to keep what I am supposed to be attending to in mind. In a situation where lots of cognitive resources is needed to maintain the "object" representation, it is possible that one can track a single target but not more. This idea of C = 1 (capacity of one) processes being involved or required for some forms of tracking is discussed more in \@ref(whichAspects). 

The notion that one end of an undifferentiated shape is an object is somewhat unnatural. It can be useful, however. When paying attention to someone holding a rifle, for example, it may be important to continuously monitor the direction that the front of the gun is pointing. The difficulty of tracking an object end is an important clue to how tracking works, which we will discuss further after laying out the predominant framework in which researchers interpret such findings.

## Object creation and object tracking: Distinct processes?

Conceptually, researchers distinguish between the processing that determines *how many* objects one can track and those that determine *what kinds* of objects can be tracked. But do these things happen in different processing stages, or do they interact? An assumption of separate processing stages is popular in the study of visual cognition generally. Visual search, for example, is usually conceptualized this way [@wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997; @nakayamaVisualSurfaceRepresentation1995], and appears to be the position assumed by [@schollObjectsAttentionState2001] in his review of objects and tracking as well as by Pylyshyn [@pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006]. <!-- No interaction between number of objects to track and what kinds of objects can be tracked.--> There certainly is evidence that tracking is relatively high-level, for example @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021 found evidence that tracking operates on perceived object position rather than more low-level representation of position.

![A schematic of the idea that objects are created prior to the action of tracking processes, which then point to the already-formed object representations but do not change them.](imagesForRmd/flowDiagrams/objectCreationTrackingSeparateDiagram.drawio.svg)

It would be convenient if object creation and object tracking occurred at distinct processing stages, as that is more straightforward to study than a more interactive system [@simonSciencesArtificialReissue1969; @sternbergDiscoveryProcessingStages1969]. There is evidence, however, that attention and object creation are interactive. For example, the way stimulus elements are organized by attention can determine what illusory contours are created and perceived, as well as the lightness and depth that is perceived [@harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019; @harrisonAttentionalSelectionIllusory2019; @peterVoluntaryAttentionModulates2005].  Our ability to perceive biological motion from only several points of light highlights that object perception can involve hierarchical motion segmentation that reflects an interaction between Gestalt grouping and top-down knowledge of the overall shape of objects and the relative motion pattern of their parts [@johanssonJohanssonVisualPerception1973; @wangSearchingLifeMotion2010] (see the section on grouping \@ref(grouping)). Using a paradigm based on that of the attentional spread literature reviewed briefly above, @ongchocoHowCreateObjects2019 asked participants to practice "seeing" certain shapes in a uniform grid of lines. The detection of flashed probes was enhanced for those presented on the same (purely imagined) object, compared with equidistant ones presented on different objects. In summary, a variety of evidence suggests a role for neural feedback in object segmentation, with some role for attention, but the extent of its importance remains unclear [@papaleInfluenceObjecthoodRepresentation2021; @wyatteEarlyRecurrentFeedback2014; @harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019].
 
Potentially, the same attentional resources that mediate tracking may also contribute to the creation of object representations. One consequence would be a trade-off between the involvement of attention in constructing object representations and the number of objects that can be tracked. Informal experience with tracking the line ends in the @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 display seems to support this. If when you watch the SCHOLL MOVIE, you concern yourself with keeping track of the end of only *one* object, you are likely to succeed. But recall that it is difficult or impossible to accurately track *four* object ends - indeed, @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 found that participants' performance was approximately that predicted if they could track one line end, but not more. This finding is consistent with the notion that some aspects of object creation tap the same attentional resource as tracking does.

An important alternative, however, is that the brain harbors a tracking resource that can be brought to bear on one object, but not multiple objects. This would mean that covert tracking of multiple objects is qualitatively different from covert tracking of a single object. It may seem unparsimonious to posit such a thing, but actually it seems there is both a hemifield-specific tracking resource and a more global resource. This is discussed in \@ref(twoBrains).

## What tracking sticks to

Even when all our cognitive resources are brought to bear on a thing, some things still can't be tracked. @anstisEyesPursueMoving2010 showed this by asking participants to track the intersection of two shapes. In what @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 called the "chopsticks illusion", a horizontal and vertical line slide over each other, each following a clockwise circular trajectory. Viewers have a very strong impression that the intersection of the two lines is also moving clockwise (demo [here](http://anstislab.ucsd.edu/illusions/chopsticks-illusion/)), but actually the intersection is moving counterclockwise and @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 found that participants could not accurately smooth pursue the intersection. The true counterclockwise trajectory of the intersection becomes obvious perceptually if one views the display through a window so that the ends of the lines are occluded rather than visible, and in that condition participants could smooth pursue the intersection accurately. @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 believe the reason that the intersection is ordinarily perceived to move in the wrong direction is because the clockwise motion of the ends of the lines is mistakenly assigned to the intersection, similar to how the motion of the ends of lines causes the barber-pole illusion. In any case, it is a failure to track a point that was rather simply defined, which indicates that there is some mandatory complex interpretation of motion and form that tracking cannot avoid. The situation here may be that, as schematized by the figure above, certain processing of motion and form occurs prior to the operation of tracking as well as cognitive processes. <!--As we will see, however, there is also reason to believe that attention can mold some object representations.-->

```

"The ends of objects" section above related the discovery that people can't track the ends of multiple objects. Evidently maintaining the representation of an undifferentiated part of an object is not something that our multiple object tracking resources are capable of. What sort of differentiation is needed? @schollWhatVisualObject2001 tested conditions that varied how distinct the end of an object was from the rest of it. In a "dumbbell" condition, each object was simply two squares connected by a line. In that condition, participants' accuracy was lower than the original separate squares condition, but not statistically significantly so. Any detriment to tracking appeared to be small, suggesting that participants could track a dumbbell end. However,  @howeCanAttentionBe2012 also used a dumbbell condition that was rather similar to that of @schollWhatVisualObject2001, but they found performance was substantially lower than when the objects (which were discs in their case) were not connected. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, and it appears it could simply be due to the noisiness of the data of the two studies. @howeCanAttentionBe2012 also tested a "luminance" condition, pictured above, and found that performance (80% correct) was substantially lower than their baseline condition (96% correct), although not as low as for undifferentiated bar ends (72% correct). They were quite surprised that the clear difference in luminance between the targets and the connector in the luminance condition was not enough to keep tracking from being so adversely affected by the connectors.

These results suggest that multiple object tracking uses a more "primitive" segmentation of objects than what is available to us when we focus our attention on a single object. These findings have some similarity to those found in conjunction visual search studies. @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997 asked participants to search for conjunctions of features, such as red and vertical. If the vertical red part of an object were physically connected to a horizontal and green part, then participants were much slower to find the red vertical target segment in the display, among the green vertical and red horizontal distractors. In other words, it seemed that physically connecting one feature to another lumped it together as an undifferentiated collection of features from the perspective of search processes, what @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997 termed a "preattentive object file". Although to my knowledge, no researcher has used the same displays of this nature for both tracking and search, the parsimonious account has to be that multiple object tracking and search operate on the same object representations.

## Growth, shrinkage, and tracking

In the real world, some objects and substances change shape rather frequently.  In the kitchen, for example, when one opens the faucet, a jet of water will shoot into the sink, and flatten on the sink's bottom, rapidly expanding into a puddle. Pouring beer into a glass, a froth forms, gradually thickening as the top of the liquid rises. These are all examples of non-rigid motion, where a substance changes shape as it moves.

@vanmarleAttentiveTrackingObjects2003 devised an object whose motion pattern resembled that of an inchworm or slinky. In one condition, which I will refer to as the "slinky" condition, each slinky began as a square. It would then move by extending its leading edge until it had the shape of a long and thin rectangle. Subsequently, the trailing edge of the slinky, which was still at its original location, would retract until the slinky was a square again, now entirely at a new location. Tracking performance was very poor in this condition. <!--the substances condition difficulty seems to be accounted for by this problem--> What is it about tracking that causes such difficulty with slinkys? @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 tested a number of conditions that ruled out issues such as the faster speed of the slinky's edges relative to the control conditions.

@schollWhatHaveWe2008 suggested that the reason the slinky was difficult to track was that "there was no unambiguous location for attention to select on this shrinking and growing extended object" because ""each object’s location could no longer be characterized by a single point" (p.63). But it is not entirely clear what is meant by an object's location not being characterizable by a single point. Consider the canonical objects used in this literature - discs with no internal features. They also have no unambiguous internal locations, because their insides are a completely undifferentiated mass. If one wishes to refer to a single point for their location, their centroid could be used, but this seems just as true for an object changing in size and shape. 

Although the mechanism is unclear, it does seem that object expansion and contraction disrupt localization. @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 presented a rectangle for 200 ms at a random location on the screen. The participants' task was to click on the location of the center of the rectangle. In a baseline condition, the rectangle did not change in size, shape or location during its 200 ms presentation. In the size-change condition, the length of the object increased due to expansion for half of the interval and shrank due to contraction during the other half. Participants' localization errors were about 14% larger in this changing-size condition. The data suggested that this was driven by errors along the axis of the object's expansion and contraction, as errors in the orthogonal direction were not significantly different from the baseline condition.

While the localization impairment documented by @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 was substantial, it is not clear whether it is large enough to account for the very low performance when tracking multiple slinkys. An important next step is to measure localization errors when the task is to monitor multiple objects changing in size rather than just one. If the localization deficit caused by change in size worsens with object load, this would help to implicate more the processes underlying tracking.

## Could tracking work by spreading?

The spatial locations of attention relative to the regions occupied by moving targets can be assessed with probe detection experiments.

By probes at various locations inside and outside of moving targets

"Center probes were detected far more accurately than end probes, suggesting that more attentional resources were concentrated on the centers of the lines than near their ends. " @alvarezHowDoesAttention2005 Reminescent of how rapid eye movements (saccades) tend to go to the centroids of objects.

Our capabilities in this regard remain understudied, but 




A "spread" of attention, or gradual growth of the area of attentional activation to encompass an entire object, is not the only conceivable process that might yield object-based attention benefits, but such spreading has been observed neurophysiologically in certain tasks [e.g., @wannigAutomaticSpreadAttentional2011]. Such a spreading process might explain the ability to keep attention on multiple moving objects.

When an object moves, if it moves smoothly, then its leading edge will occupy new territory while its trailing edge continues to occupy an old location. If spreading of attention up to object boundaries is continually occurring, then attention should spread to the new locations near the trailing edge. In such a fashion, attention could, by continually expanding to the new location of a leading edge and contracting with a trailing edge, stay on a moving object. Some problems with this account, discussed in SECTION X <!-- Point objects, stepping objects (works for 1 target and probably for multiple ones if they are stepping a short distance), and the finding that attention tends to be ahead of an object? I don't recall whether that's been done -->, suggest that spreading of attention is not sufficient to explain tracking, but it may play a role.

Out the kitchen window, in the dense foliage of a tree, two birds squabble on the wing. As they plummet from one branch to another, you see only parts of each at any one time. An outstretched wing partially obscured by leaves and a branch, which folds in on itself as the bird alights on a branch and parts of its body comes into view. In addition to occlusion, camouflage can also cause the visible portions of animals to change in shape as they move from one background to another.

## Summing up


Many questions remain regarding what sorts of objects attention gloms onto.


TRANSITION TO NEXT SECTION on CAPACITY-1 PROCESSES: (ALSO see above on tracking part of an object)
 
This proposition, that there are actually two resources that can assist tracking, one with much more limited capacity (perhaps for just one object) and the other with fewer capabilities but higher capacity, is an intriguing one but not
Those abilties of ours that have a capacity of just one remain somewhat obscure. There is an extensive literature on two-object costs. words Alex White However, 



<!--chapter:end:objects.Rmd-->

# Grouping {#grouping}

Carving the scene into objects is not the only segmenting that is done by the visual system. We also perceive groups, formed by a variety of cues, as chronicled by the Gestalt psychologists. It is quite possible, likely even, that tracking follows entire groups rather than individual elements of a group. @alzahabiEnsemblePerceptionMultipleobject2021 used clusters of several discs as targets and distractors. These clusters maintained a constant spatial arrangement as they wandered about the display. Participants seemed to do well at tracking these clusters. Unfortunately these researchers did not rule out the possibility that participants were tracking just one disc of each cluster, however, and I am not aware of any work that provided strong evidence that a tracking focus tracks an entire group.

@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesized that in MOT experiments, participants track an imaginary shape formed by the targets, specifically a polygon whose vertices are the target positions. Progress has been slow in understanding whether all participants do this or just a minority do, and in what circumstances.

@merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 found a result that they took as evidence that some participants track a shape defined by the targets while others do not. In their task, when the targets and distractors stopped moving at the end of the trial, four of them were highlighted again and the task was to press one button if all four were targets (match), and to press a different button otherwise (non-match). Error rates were lowest when none of the objects highlighted were targets, and errors were progressively more common as the number of highlighted objects that were targets increased. This was unsurprising. However, for trials where all four of the highlighted objects were the targets (match), error rates were much lower than when only three were targets. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 suggested that this reflected a "perceptual strategy of monitoring the global shape configuration of the tracked target items." They went on to split the participants based on whether they had a relatively low error rate in the match condition, investigated the neural correlates of that, and made various conclusions about the neural processing that underlies virtual shape tracking.

These inferences of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 are all based on the split of participants based on low error rate in the match condition compared to the condition where none of the highlighted objects match. The idea seems to be that if participants weren't using a shape tracking strategy, error rates would steadily increase from the trials where none of the highlighted objects were targets to the trials where all of the objects highlighted were targets. However, there are other possible reasons for this pattern of results.

One unusual aspect of the @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 experiment is that one of the two response choices (non-match) was the correct answer in 80% of trials. Because participants were not told that, some of them surely expected that they should press the two buttons approximately equally often. By pressing the match button more often (close to 50% of trials) than the appropriate 20% of trials, they would artificially have the relatively low error rate for the full-match condition that was observed. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 mention the possibility of a response bias but suggest that this would result in the opposite (a high error rate) to what I have suggested. The problem seems to be that they didn't consider that the participants may have expected the match stimulus to occur more often than it did.

That sort of response bias is not the only alternative to the virtual grouping account of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014. The  low error rate in the full-match condition might also occur for other reasons. Imagine that a participant tracked only one target and simply checked that target at the end of each trial for whether it was highlighted. If that one target is not highlighted, the participant presses the non-match button, otherwise they press the match button. For such a participant, the chance of getting the answer wrong when none of the probed objects are targets is zero. It is higher when one of the probed objects is a target (25% if the participant tracks one target perfectly on every trial and makes no finger errors), and still higher when two or three probed objects is a target. When three probed objects are targets, in three out of four cases, one of them is the target the participant tracked, so the participant frequently gets it wrong. But when all four of the probed objects are targets, the participant will always respond correctly. Thus, a low error rate in this all-targets-probed condition that is very close to the error rate in the no-targets-probed condition can be a sign of a participant who only monitors one target. But @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 interpreted this result as instead meaning that the participant was tracking a virtual shape formed by all four of the targets.

<!--This doesn't address their correlation argument. Correlation predictions. Simplest version of my account is that only lapse rate differs between participants. High lapse rate contributes most to M0 and M4 variance, so if lapse rate is driving individual differences, correlation between M4 and M0 should be higher than M4 with other conditions, which it is. But for M1 and M2 I'm not sure why correlations so high.

Does Pearson correlations not affected by base rate for an error rate variable? I think not, so if there is a floor effect for M4, it should have a smaller correlation with everything else. But actually M0- has the lowest error rate and it has higher correlations.

What if you track three targets? Decision rule: if all three match, say yes, otherwise no. Then in M4 you will get 0% error rate again. With M3, 25%? error rate, then smaller for M2, M1, M0.  

Why would you ever say 'no' in M4? It would have to be because you ended up tracking the wrong target(s). But if you know you sometimes end up tracking a wrong target(s), if 3 of your 4 targets match 3 of those highlighted, then maybe your decision rule is to say 'yes'. So then sometimes you get M4 wrong. And in M3, you could get even more wrong, because you are happy with just 3 being the same. In M2, you might get less wrong.

Participants could differ in A) lapse rate; B) number tracked; C) decision rule.
They claim that half of participants have a big difference . But these might be the non-holistic participants. If I track holistically, with some noise in my virtual polygon representation I get M4 most correct? I get M3 most wrong, M2 less wrong, M1 even less, and M0 all correct.

-->


<!--Imagine you just check one target on every trial for whether it is highlighted. Chance of getting it wrong is zero at M0 ,progressively higher for M1, M2, and M3. But then at M4, should go back to zero. So this effect is unsurprising. And if you select people with low error rates for M4, you might be grabbing people who only tracked one target. But Merkel probably think they're grabbing people who tracked holistically.

They correlated M4 with everything else, and those correlations were lower than M1 with M2, M2 with M3, etc. Whereas all participants responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the match-0 trials, about half of the participants also responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the full-match trials. These latter participants also tended to make more errors on match-3 trials than did the other half of the participants.

## Hierarchical relations 

In the real world, the movement across our retinas are rarely as independent as the moving objects in a typical multiple object tracking experiment. Often there is a strong motion element throughout the visual field created by the movement of the observer, and recovering true object movement may involve detecting deviations from that. Even when the observer is completely still, hierarchical motion relationships are common. When one views a tree on a windy day, the largest branches sway slowly, while the smaller limbs attached to the larger branches move with the larger branches but also, being lighter, have their own, more rapid motion.

Our visual systems are tuned to relative motion [@tadinWhatConstitutesEfficient2002; @maruyaRapidEncodingRelationships2013]. When we see a wheel roll by, we experience any features on the wheel as moving forward, reflecting the global frame of the entire wheel, but also as moving in a circle, reflecting the motion relative to the center of the wheel.

This decomposition of the rim's movement is so strong that people systematically mis-report the trajectory of the points on the wheel [@proffittUnderstandingWheelDynamics1990]. The red curve in the animation below reveals that a point on a rolling wheel traces out a curve that involves up, down, and forward motion, but no backward motion. The trajectory reported by participants is very different and tends to include a period of backward motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="The red curve is that traced out by a point on a rolling wheel, by Zorgit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cycloid_f.gif"}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f_static.gif")
```

Our visual system seems to represent complex motion hierarchically. @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020 varied the structured motion pattern of the moving discs of an MOT task to show that hierarchical relations are extracted and used to facilitate tracking.
The attentional demands, if any, of such hierarchical motion decomposition has not been explored much.

<!-- Mention the bendy-pencil illusion https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193187 maybe.  "the illusory bending motion may be due to an inability of observers to accurately track the motions of features whose image displacements undergo rapid simultaneous changes in both space and time" -->


Investigations of this question have been informed by the long history of findings, dating back to the Gestalt psychologists, regarding how the visual system segments a scene into the objects or groups that we perceive.

## Eyes to the center

The human visual system represents scenes as more than just a collection of objects. A rapid global analysis of visual scenes is performed, giving us summary information that is sometimes referred to as ensemble statistics [@alvarezSpatialEnsembleStatistics2009]. The location of the center or centroid of the objects in a scene is useful for eye movement planning, among other things. To monitor a group of objects, it is helpful to look at the center of the group, as that can minimize how far into peripheral vision they are situated. 

In 2008, @zelinskyEyeMovementAnalysis2008 and @fehdEyeMovementsMultiple2008 independently reported that during multiple object tracking, in addition to gazing directly at targets, the eyes of many participants frequently are directed at blank locations near the center of the array of targets. This basic finding has been replicated by a substantial amount of subsequent work [@hyonaEyeBehaviorMultiple2019]. The nature of the central point is not entirely clear, however. Researchers have suggested that it may be the average of the current locations of the targets, or the average location of all the moving objects (both targets and distractors). Another possibility that has been investigated is that participants tend to look at the centroid of the shape formed by the targets, which recalls the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that what is tracked is the shape defined by the targets. Finally, @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 introduced the idea of the "anti-crowding point", which is the point that minimizes the ratio between each target's distance from the gaze point and distance from every distractor. The idea was that participants move their gaze closer to a target when it is near a distractor to avoid confusing targets with distractors.

In a comparison of all these metrics against eyetracking data, @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 found that the anti-crowding point best predicted participants' gaze in his experiment, followed by the average of the target locations. These points both matched the data better than the centroid of the targets. This undermines somewhat the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that a virtual polygon is tracked, and the finding of best performance by the anti-crowding point is consistent with other results that participants tend to look closer to targets that are near other objects 
[@vaterDisentanglingVisionAttention2017; @zelinskyRoleRescueSaccades2010].

More work must be done to understand the possible role of an anti-crowding eye movement strategy. Because spatial interference in displays does not seem to extend further than half an object's eccentricity, in both static identification tasks [@pelliUncrowdedWindowObject2008' @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011] and multiple object tracking [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014], the anti-crowding point devised by @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 ought to be pitted against a measure incorporating the finding that distractors further than about half an object's eccentricity do not cause spatial interference and thus can perhaps be excluded from the calculation.

# Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance? {#whichAspects}

As @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 pointed out, the processes underlying task performance come in two varieties, data-limited and resource-limited. In the context of tracking we are referring to sensory data. If the targets to track go outside our visual field, it is a lack of sensory data that prevents them from being tracked. No amount of mental resources can overcome the absence of any data, hence the term data-limited. This may also be true of cases where sensory signals are not entirely absent, but they are impoverished.

More subtle forms of this can explain some individual differences in task performance. For example, people with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, again due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Depending on the task bringing more mental resources to bear may provide little to no benefit. The classic way this is investigated is by varying the number of stimuli one needs to process. @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 illustrate this with a visual search study by BeckAmbler
, which is most familiar from the study of visual search. If the number of stimuli one must evaluate does not affect how well a person can perform a task, this indicates the task is data-limited rather than resource-limited. Of course, attention does benefit 

More reflections on the relation of the resource concept to underlying mechanisms is in section \@ref(spatialInterference)

tracking ability. For example, people with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, again due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Depending on the task

The other type of task limitation is resource-limited processes. These are more interesting for those interested in visual attention and the capacity limits on mental processing introduced in section \@ref(bottlenecks).


That the number of objects one can track varies greatly with factors like speed is consistent with resource accounts. This 

Every time someone discovers a factor that affects visual search performance, it is worthwhile to ask whether that factor is taxing a resource-limited process or a data-limited process. That is, will increasing the number of targets exacerbate the effect of that factor?

The absence of a hard limit or 


The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on conditions. Still, it is clear that this number is small relative to the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early stages of the visual system. So, what aspect exactly of tracking imposes this limitation?

Explain why the resource intensiveness aspect of tracking is more interesting than other aspects.

Why do people perform more poorly with more targets? By definition, this means that the processes underlying tracking are capacity-limited, but by itself, that description is not very illuminating. Covert tracking is a complex task, and we would like to know which aspect(s) of it exactly are most capacity-limited.

Below is a list of candidate reasons for the factors that impair performance more when there are more targets:
In a typical MOT task, any of the below are candidates for being one of the reasons, or the main reason, that performance declines with number of targets:

1. General cognition (C≈1 processes)
1. Concurrent tasks
1. Duration that one can sustain attention
1. Spatial selection of multiple locations (even static ones)
1. Spatial interference
1. Temporal interference
1. Speed limit of attention-following

This section will explain what is meant by each of these factors. The most important of them will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

<!-- Each of these processes could be resource-limited or not resource-limited. That is, some of these effects may be bigger when one is attending to more targets. This helps fractionate tracking into different kinds of constituent processes -->

## General cognition (C≈1 processes)

In introducing the concept of a bottleneck or capacity limit in the previous section, I used the example of math problems. Using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through tracking a single object. For purposes of illustration, let us call the processes involved "C≈1 processes" to reflect the possibility that some cognitive processes involved have a capacity of only one object.

Oberauer

What makes MOT interesting to many is that we can track more than one target. This implicates the involvement of another, higher-capacity sort of processing. The contribution to MOT of two kinds of processing, with different capacity limits, complicates the interpretation of MOT results. Even when participants are asked to track several targets, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets.

Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C≈1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->

## Duration that one can sustain attention

Tracking may be, in part, a test of how long one can sustain attention. There also is some possibility that additional demands on attention (more targets) reducing the average amount of time one can sustain attention without a lapse. The results of @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007, suggest that this need not be the case. In their Experiment 3, participants were required to track four targets for a period of ten minutes. Every 9 seconds or so, one object was highlighted and participants had to indicate whether it was one of the targets. In a no-feedback condition, participants were not told whether their individual responses were correct. In that situation, performance was substantially worse in the last few minutes of the trial than in the first few minutes (78% correct vs. 65% correct). However, in the feedback condition wherein participants were told immediately after each judgment whether they were correct, performance did not appear to decline over time. These results suggest that if participants are adequately motivated by feedback, they have considerable ability to track for several minutes with no appreciable loss. The comparison between the feedback and no-feedback conditions is not perfect as the feedback does provide a cue that can increase performance (when participants get the probe wrong, they can increase subsequent performance somewhat by switching to another target), but this confound does not seem to be able to explain the lack of almost any performance loss in the feedback condition.

The circumstances used by @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 were quite different from a prototypical MOT task, not least because of the extended durations of the trials. Most researchers use trial durations of less than 10 seconds, and it is not clear whether the @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 results would generalize. It seems likely that motivated participants can attend for several seconds before their attention wanes substantially. @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 did find, however, a substantial decrease in performance for trials of 13 s compared to trials of 5 s. With four targets, for example, performance fell from 91% correct to 74% correct, and this decrease was somewhat greater for larger numbers of targets than for fewer targets. Byrne & Holcombe (unpublished data) did not find any significant decrease over a comparable interval, and the explanation for these discrepancies is uncertain, although it may again be related to participants' motivation.

The reason for the reduction in performance with greater time observed by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 may easily be due to another factor rather than an increase in lapses of attention. In the MOT tasks used by all of these researchers, with longer trials there is likely to be more instances of potential spatial interference, temporal interference, and running afoul of any attentional speed limit. Thus, if any of those factors matter, they could explain the decrease in performance with time. However, the @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 does seem to provide a kind of existence proof that lapses of attention need not be the limiting factor. Granting that that may be the case, an additional question is why, if other factors are in operation, there was *no* evidence of a performance decrease over time in @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007? Well, @wolfeMultipleObjectJuggling2007 averaged performance over approximately the first third of the ten-minute interval and compared it to the last third. In the feedback condition, it is possible that all the worst possible events (such as close approaches, causing greater spatial interference) had already occurred by the end of the first third, so whatever level of performance participants were left with at that point already reflected their capacity to track through the most difficult events, which they were then able to continue to do until the end of the trial. Over a shorter time range such as that used by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, this may not have been the case.
 
## Spatial selection of multiple locations



## Spatial interference



## Temporal interference

Temporal interference is analogous to spatial interference, just in time rather than in space. Spatial interference refers to a processing impairment when one object comes closer than a certain spatial distance to a second object, at one time. In contrast, temporal interference refers to when an object comes closer than a certain temporal distance of another, at one point in space.

The objects in typical MOT displays often travel over locations formerly occupied by another moving object. That is, after one object passes over a location, another will pass over the same location, some amount of time later. If temporal interference is a factor in object tracking, then if the amount of time that separates the two objects occupying a location is short enough, tracking will be impaired.

If objects are moving fast enough, they are perceived to blur together, because some parts of the visual system integrate over several dozen milliseconds [e.g., @hogbenPerceptualIntegrationPerceptual1974]. A more interesting question is whether temporal interference occurs on a longer timescale, more relevant to the speeds and spacings typically used in MOT tasks.

## Speed limit of attention-following


## Moving forward

Each of these could hinder performance more with more targets. They contribute in an unknown mix to most tracking tasks .
Thus we don't know which is responsible for various results. For example,

# Spatial interference {#spatialInterference}

Details of the world that are much smaller than ourselves, like the individual fibers of a piece of paper, or the different-colored blotches laid down on paper by a printer, that look to us like a uniform splash of red, are inaccessible to the naked eye - our photoreceptors are too large and widely-spaced. Our finite spatial acuity is a familiar limit on our visual abilities, one that is measured every time we go to the optometrist. Line segments or objects that are too close together are experienced is a single unit.

Even when two objects are spaced far apart enough that they can easily be seen to be two objects rather than one, they are not processed entirely separately by the brain. Receptive fields grow larger and larger as visual signals ascend the visual hierarchy, and this can result in a degraded representation in the visual system for objects that are near each other. In other words, spatial interference ensues.

<!--Decades before @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 conducted experiments on the selection of multiple locations with different densities, researchers had recognized the existence of spatial interference in dense displays-->
A large body of psychophysical work has investigated the display densities that impair object perception. Common tasks in this literature include letter identification and grating orientation discrimination [e.g., @wolfordPerturbationModelLetter1975; @korteUberGestaltauffassungIm1923; @strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "When one gazes at the central dot, the central letter to the left is not crowded, but the central letter to the right is."}

}")
```

In the above display, if you gaze at the central dot, you likely will be able to perceive the middle letter to the left fairly easily as a 'J'. However, if while keeping your eyes fixed on the central dot you instead try to perceive the central letter to the right, the task is much more difficult. This spatial interference phenomenon is called "crowding" in the perception literature.

Most studies of crowding ask participants to identify a target such as a letter when flanking stimuli are placed at various separations from the target. The separation needed to avoid crowding varies depending on the display spatial arrangement, but on average is about half the eccentricity of the target; the interference diminishes rapidly as separation increases beyond that [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970a; @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011]. In the display above, for example, the letters on the same side as the 'J' are separated from it by more than half the 'J's distance from the fixation point, so they have little to no effect on its identification.

When flankers are presented close to a target, they not only prevent identification of the target, they can also prevent the target from being individually selected by attention, which likely spells trouble for multiple object tracking [@intriligatorSpatialResolutionVisual2001]. When a target and distractor are too close to be distinguished by tracking processes, the tracking process may inadvertently end up tracking a distractor rather than the target.

Crowding happens frequently in typical MOT displays, in that in most experiments, objects are not prevented from coming within half the eccentricity of each other. It is not surprising, then, that in typical MOT displays,
greater proximity of targets and distractors is associated with poor performance [@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008; @tombuAttentionalCostsMultipleobject2008].

## Spatial interference does not explain why tracking many targets is more difficult than tracking only a few

<!-- MOVE TO PREFACE TO SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL INTERFERENCE The errors in MOT occur largely when a target and a distractor come close to each other, in space or in time. During a close encounter between a target and a distractor, one may end up tracking the distractor rather than the target.
 @baeCloseEncountersDistracting2012 @drewSwappingDroppingElectrophysiological2012 -->

@franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a claimed that spatial interference is the *only* reason why performance is worse when more targets are to be tracked, denying any role for speed, time, or a resource that is depleted when more targets must be tracked. They posited that tracking errors, other than lapses of concentration, are caused entirely by the poor spatial resolution of tracking's selection process, together with inhibitory surrounds that can cause mutual interference among the selection of nearby targets. The most provocative tenet of their theory was that "there is no limit on the number of trackers, and no limit per se on tracking capacity" (p.920), implying that a very large number of targets could be tracked if they were kept far apart from each other.

In pursuing tests of this theory, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a unfortunately did not isolate the separation between objects from other display variables. More generally in the literature, MOT studies rarely control the retinal separation among the objects in a display. For example, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a kept object trajectories essentially constant in their experiments but varied the total distance traveled by the objects (by varying both speed and trial length), on the basis that if close encounters were the only cause of errors, they should be proportional to the total distance traveled. When they found that performance did decrease with distance traveled, but there was little effect of the different object speeds and trial durations that they used, they took this as strong support for their theory that only spatial proximity mattered.

As @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a wrote in their conclusion, their hypothesis that "barring object-spacing constraints, people could reliably track an unlimited number of objects as fast as they could track a single object" constituted a "simple and falsifiable hypothesis". I believed this hypothesis to be unlikely to be true, and on obvious test was to keep all the objects in an MOT display widely separated, vary the number of targets, and measure the speed threshold in each case.

In 2012, my student Wei-Ying Chen and I conducted several experiments in this vein. In one, we used an ordinary computer screen but had participants bring their noses quite close to it to create a wide-field display, which allowed us to keep targets and distractors dozens of degrees of visual angle from each other @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012. The basic display configuration is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:HC2012BasicTrial).

```{r HC2012BasicTrial, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="In experiments by Holcombe & Chen (2012), after the targets were highlighted in white, all the discs became red and revolved about the fixation point. During this interval, each pair of discs occasionally reversed their direction. After 3–3.8 s the discs stop, one ring is indicated by presenting text next to it, and the participant clicks on one disc of that ring."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/HolcombeChen2012BasicTrial.png")
```

We found that even with objects extremely widely-spaced speed thresholds declined dramatically with the number of targets. To us, this appeared to falsify the theory of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a. Indeed, for the 2011 Vision Sciences Society conference where we reported these findings, we entitled our poster entitled "The resource theory of tracking is right! - at high speeds one may only be able to track a single target (even if no crowding occurs". What we meant was that each target takes up some of a very limited processing capacity - a resource that was attentional in that it could be applied anywhere in the visual field, or at least anywhere within a hemifield (\@ref(twoBrains)). The amount of this resource applied to a target determines the fastest speed at which a target can be tracked.

Franconeri, together with his colleagues George Alvarez and Patrick Cavanagh (of whom the latter was, incidentally, my PhD advisor) were not convinced by the findings of Wei-Ying Chen and I. Franconeri et al. not only continued to push their spatial interference theory of tracking, but also they suggested the same basic idea could explain capacity limits on object recognition, visual working memory, and motor control, writing that "competitive interactions are the roots of capacity limits for tasks such as object recognition and multiple object tracking” (p.2) and that capacity limits arise only because "items interact destructively when they are close enough for their activity profiles to overlap" (p.2) @franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013. Yet to explain the @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 results, the spatial interference posited by Franconeri would have to extend over a very long distance, farther than anything that had been reported in behavioral studies. Furthermore, if there were such long-range spatial gradients of interference present, they should have shown up in the results of @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 as worse performance for the intermediate spatial separations we tested than for the largest separations we tested.

To address these issues with their theory, @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 appealed to data from recordings in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of rhesus macaque monkeys. In a study by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010, the monkeys were presented with a saccade target, and the monkey was cued to execute a saccade to it by offset of the fixation point. In some trials, however, another stimulus was flashed 50 ms prior to the offset of the fixation point. That flashed stimulus was positioned in the receptive field of an LIP cell the researchers were recorded from, and it was found that its response was suppressed relative to trials when there was not a saccade target. This was true even when the saccade target was very far away, with statistically significant impairment at separations up to 40 deg for some cells. There was a spatial gradient, but the data suggested it could be quite shallow, allowing @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 to write that "levels of surround suppression are strong at both distances, and thus no difference in performance is expected" for the separations tested by Holcombe and Chen (2012). Note that @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 was published as an online comment at _Trends in Cognitive Sciences_, as a reply to my online comment pointing out some of the problems with their theory. Unfortunately, some time later, probably in 2018, both comments were lost by the publisher, Elsevier, when they migrated their system. In the case of my comment, however, I found an old version on my computer, updated it slightly and posted it at @holcombeCommentCapacityLimits2019.

One property of the neural suppression documented by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 strongly suggests it is not one of the processes that limit our ability to track multiple objects. Specifically, @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 found that nearly as often as not, the location in the visual field that yielded the most suppression was not in the same hemifield as the receptive field center. But as we will see in \@ref(twoBrains) the cost of additional targets in attentional tracking is largely independent in the two hemifields, suggesting that LIP suppression is not the main factor yielding worse performance when there are more targets. Instead, as @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 themselves concluded, these LIP cells may help mediate a global salience computation for prioritizing saccade or attentional targets wherever they are in the visual field.

In light of all the above, it seemed the evidence ruled against the idea that spatial interference was the sole reason that people perform worse with more targets.  By 2013, the spatial interference account advocated by Franconeri seemed to have been watered down until it was practically indistinguishable from a resource theory. That is, if spatial interference extended over an entire visual field (or hemifield) with no detectable diminution at large separations relative to small separations, then it no longer seemed appropriate to refer to it as "spatial" interference. Instead, finite processing capacity seems to be both a more parsimonious and straightforward description.

The word "resource" appropriately conveys that people can choose how to apply their finite processing capacity, as a resource is something that is available to someone and can be used in different ways. For example, it suggests that one can use half of one's processing capacity for one target while using the other half for a second target. The validity of this part of the metaphor is addressed by some experimental evidence reviewed in \@ref(twoBrains) and \@ref(serialOrParallel).

Having failed to find evidence for long-range spatial interference, I decided to investigate the form of spatial interference that I was confident actually existed: short-range interference. As mentioned in the first section of this chapter, we were already confident that short-range spatial interference existed, from some previous studies of tracking. However, these studies did not provide much evidence about how far that interference extended - either they did not control eccentricity (e.g. @feriaSpeedHasEffect2013) or they only tested a few separations (e.g. @tombuTrackingPlanetsMoons2011). 

In experiments published in 2014, we assessed tracking performance for two targets for various separations between the targets' trajectories [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. Performance improved with separation, but only up to a distance of about half the target's eccentricity, similar to what has typically been found in the crowding literature [@strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014]. In a few experiments there was a trend for better performance even as separation increased beyond the crowding zone, but this effect was small and not statistically significant. In all experiments performance was substantially worse for large separations, even for the largest separation tested of 59 degrees of visual angle. These findings supported my suspicion that spatial interference is largely confined to the crowding range, and that the performance deficit when there are more targets to track is caused by a limited processing resource.

The experiments we reported in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did yield one surprise. In the one-target conditions, outside the crowding range we found that performance actually decreased with separation from the other pair of (untracked) objects. This unexpected  cost of separation was only statistically significant in one experiment, but the trend was present in all four experiments that varied separation outside the crowding range. This might potentially be explained by the configural or group-based processing that I reviewed in \@ref(grouping), as grouping of distant elements tends to occur less often than for nearby elements [e.g., @kubovyLawfulnessGroupingProximity1998].

What is the nature of the short-range spatial interference that we and others have documented? As explained in the beginning of this chapter, one cause of spatial interference is simply lack of spatial resolution by the processes that mediate tracking. If a process cannot distinguish between two locations, either because of a noisy representation of those locations or because the two locations are treated as one, then a target may often be lost when it comes too close to a distractor. This would be true of any imperfect mechanism, regardless of whether it is biological or man-made.

While some form of spatial interference or confusion is well-nigh universal, the particular way that the human visual system is put together may result in forms of spatial interference that do not occur in, for example, computer algorithms engineered for object tracking. As described in \@ref(bottlenecks), our visual processing architecture has a pyramid-like structure, with processing at the retina being local and massively parallel, and then gradually converging such that neurons at higher stages have receptive fields responsive to large regions. At these higher stages processes critical to tasks like tracking or face recognition occur. Face-selective neurons, for example, are situated in temporal cortex and have very large receptive fields. For tracking, while the parietal cortex is thought to be more important than the temporal cortex, the neurons in these parietal areas again have large receptive fields.

A large receptive field presents a problem when the task is to recognize an object in clutter or to track a moving target in the presence of nearby moving distractors. In the case of object recognition, without a mechanism to prevent processing of the other objects that share the receptive field, object recognition would have access to only a mishmash of the objects' features. Indeed, this indiscriminate combining of features is thought to be one reason for perceptual illusory conjunctions. Similarly, for object tracking, isolating the target is necessary to keep it distinguished from the distractors.

In principle, our visual systems might include attentional processes that when selecting a target can completely exclude distractors' visual signals from reaching the larger receptive fields. Actually implementing such a system using realistic biological mechanisms with our pyramid architecture, however, looks to be difficult [@tsotsosModelingVisualAttention1995]. Neural recordings reveal that while the signals from stimuli irrelevant to the current task are suppressed somewhat, they still affect neural responses. The particular mechanism used by our visual system appears to include active suppression of a region around a target, which has long been championed by the computer scientist John Tsotsos as a practical way for high-level areas of the brain to isolate a stimulus in their large receptive fields. This suppression likely involves descending connections from high-level areas and possibly recurrent processing [@tsotsosDifferentStagesVisual2008].

Note that on this account, it is only targets, not distractors, that have a region of suppression surrounding them. One consequence of this is that when one tracks more than one target, there is the potential for the targets to suppress each other's selection process. Indeed, this was one basis of the contention of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a that the limit on number of targets that can be tracked was caused entirely by spatial interference. While their attempt to attribute all of the cost of tracking additional targets to surround suppression may be misguided, in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 we did find some tentative evidence supporting a greater range of interference in the two-target condition compared to the one-target condition. Again, the effect was small relative to the total additional-target performance cost. It appears that overlapping surround suppression associated with targets may impair tracking, but the spatial range of this does not extend much beyond the classic crowding range.

<!-- p.11:"the effect of separation was not significantly greater in the two- target condition than the one-target condition, but the difference did approach significance. Experiment 2: F(1, 7) 1⁄4 3.52, p=0.103. Experiment 3: F(1, 9) 1⁄4 3.89, p=0.054. Such an interaction would be consistent with the proposal that attending to an object results in an inhibitory surround, as attention to the two targets could then inhibit each other. This interaction is small, however, relative to the size of the additional-target cost (see Figure 7), suggesting that crowding is not responsible for much of the additional-target cost."
--> 

<!--While the @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010a spatial interference theory is still frequently cited uncritically, the evidence against it seems to be strong.-->

Crowding, or the impairment of object identification by nearby objects, has generally been studied more extensively than the spatial interference associated with object tracking. Like for tracking, however, the possibility of suppression around targets remains understudied. Very few studies of crowding have varied the number of targets. I have found one study of the identification of briefly-presented stimuli which found that attending to additional gratings within the crowding range of a first grating resulted in greater impairment in the letter identification task [@mareschalAttentionalModulationCrowding2010]. This is consistent with the existence of surround suppression around each target. <!--Unfortunately, however, the study did not investigate how much further, if at all, spatial interference extended when there are more targets.--> 

<!--As reviewed by @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014, while dozens of MOT papers have manipulated spatial proximity, few have both required fixation and scaled separation with eccentricity such that the relationship of target load and the range of spatial interference could be directly assessed.-->

<!--MENTION THAT HOLCOMBECHEN FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR SPATIAL INTERFERENCE WITH 12 OBJECTS SHARING A CIRCULAR TRAJECTORY-->

In summary, spatial interference likely contributes to many errors in tracking when targets and distractors come close to each other. This may be mediated partly by surround suppression around targets, as well as the inherent ambiguity regarding which is a target and which is a distractor during close encounters for a limited spatial resolution system. When objects are kept widely separated, it appears that spatial interference plays little to no role in tracking. Some other factor or factors, such as some sort of attentional resource, is needed to explain the dramatic decline in tracking performance that can be found with more targets even in widely-spaced displays [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013].
<!--As will become clear in the next section, however, in such conditions, temporal interference can determine tracking performance. -->

## Spatial selection of multiple locations

While multiple object tracking seems to require maintaining selection of moving objects, one can also ask about the capacity to maintain selection of stationary objects. If one cannot select the objects when they are stationary, perhaps one has no chance of tracking them when they are moving. Actually, the differing motion direction of moving objects may facilitate distinguishing among them, which will be discussed in section \@ref(beyondLocation), but nevertheless the processes that allow selection of multiple stationary objects are very likely part and parcel of those that support tracking.

Is selection of static objects resource-limited? @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 investigated this with two concentric circular arrays of stationary dots that were centered on fixation. Between one and eight of the dots were briefly highlighted, and then each dot was replaced by either a small horizontal or a small vertical bar. The participants' task was to search for a vertical bar, which was guaranteed to appear in the previously-cued locations. The participants were to press one key if a vertical bar was present among the cued locations, and another key if none of those locations contained a vertical bar.

In a sparse display with twelve locations, @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 found that average performance dropped from 98% when two locations were cued to 91% when six locations were cued. This decrease is fairly small, suggesting that if the result were to generalize to typical MOT displays, spatial selection processes would contribute only a small portion of the performance decrease with greater set sizes. However, MOT studies frequently allow objects to come much closer to each other than the spacing that @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 used in their sparse condition. In the denser conditions tested by @franconeriHowManyLocations2007, performance again started at a very high level for two cued locations, but dropped much more, to 74% correct or less for six cued locations.

It is difficult to know how these results can be translated into MOT tasks. The selection demands in a typical MOT task may be less taxing than in the @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 experiments, because participants need only maintain their attention on the objects, not search through them. However, it remains unclear how much less demanding that is, so we still do not know how much of the target-load effect in typical MOT displays can be attributed to failures of selection that would occur even were the objects to remain stationary.

In practice, people make many more errors in a tracking task if the targets move than if they do not move (CITATION NEEDED). This observation is not enough, however, to conclude that the limits on spatial selection are not the cause of most errors in moving-object tracking. One reason is that visual working memory can greatly benefit performance with static locations, but memory for locations likely does not update very well in the presence of motion, as will be discussed in section \@ref(identity).

# The role of motion {#beyondLocation} 

Covert tracking keeps one up to date with the locations of objects of interest. Knowing objects' locations is sometimes important in itself. Also it allows us to quickly bring focused attention to one or more of the objects. When focused attention is applied to an object, that allows even our most limited-capacity processes to operate on the object, which seems to be necessary to, for example, make fine shape discriminations or recognize a word [@whiteVisualWordRecognition2020].

The information that focused attention can deliver might conceivably benefit tracking for any target frequently focused on. One possible example is the direction and speed that a target is moving in. If this information is used to anticipate future positions of the objects, then performance should be better when objects maintain straight-line trajectories than when they frequently change their direction.

The evidence below suggests that the capacity limit on the use of motion information during tracking may be more severe than that on the use of position. That is, in conditions where participants can use position information to accurately track four or five targets, they may only use motion information for one or two of the targets. This may mean that the use of motion information can be identified with the extended cognitive processing of an object that likely can only occur for one or at most a few targets, which was referred to in section \@ref(whichAspects) as C≈1 processes. 

@howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 compared a condition in which the objects moved in straight lines, only changing direction when they bounced off the arena's boundaries, to when the objects' trajectories were not predictable because they changed direction randomly about every half second. However, this advantage for tracking the predictable trajectories was found when there were two targets, but not when there were four targets. @vulExplainingHumanMultiple2009 asked participants to track three targets and varied how much and how often the objects changed their velocity. They found little to no detriment of the velocity changes on participants' estimates of difficulty. Unfortunately they did not assess whether velocity continuity became beneficial with fewer targets.

In the @howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 experiments, participants were allowed to move their eyes. They may have moved their eyes to follow one target, or alternatively something like the centroid of the targets (see \@ref(grouping)), and as eye movements have some associated inertia, that tendency to continue moving the eyes in the same direction might have contributed to the predictable trajectory benefit, and it makes sense that this would boost conditions with fewer targets more given that the eyes only move in one direction at a time. @luuExtrapolationOccursMultiple2015 followed up on the @howeMotionInformationSometimes2012 results using similar experiment parameters but added a requirement that participants fixate at the center of the screen throughout a trial, and found a very similar pattern of results.

These results converge nicely with those of @fencsikRoleLocationMotion2007, who made targets invisible for a brief period (307 ms) and participants attempted to continue tracking when they re-appeared after the interval in the locations expected if they had continued moving in the same direction and speed as when they disappeared. Participants were able to do this when there were one or two targets but not four targets, as evidenced by better performance compared to a control condition where prior motion information was not available.

@wangRoleKinematicProperties2021 devised displays that allowed them to compare the extent to which participants used position information, velocity, and acceleration during tracking. Consistent with previous investigations, velocity was used less than position, and was subject to a more severe capacity limit. Acceleration (extrapolation of change in motion direction) did not seem to be used at all.

## Velocity as a feature for correspondence matching?

For tracking, motion information could be used in two different ways. One is to solve what is referred to as the "correspondence problem". To understand this, imagine that the moving objects in an MOT display were sampled by a computer only once every three hundred milliseconds (something like this may be what the brain does when there are several targets, if attention samples objects serially - \@ref(serialOrParallel)). The correspondence problem is to determine the correspondence between the objects of the two frames. That is, solving the correspondence problem means knowing where an object in the first frame is in the second frame. This is not at all a theoretical problem - the rise of CCTV a few decades ago sparked a rapid growth in the development of algorithms for tracking objects in low frame rate video [@kamkarMultipletargetTrackingHuman2020]. The correct answers for which objects in frames 1 and 2 correspond to each other will in many cases be provided by the nearest-neighbor match. Nearest-neighbor here simply means matching each object in frame 1 to that closest to it in frame 2.

For some object trajectories, the nearest-neighbor match yields the wrong answer to the correspondence problem. For example, if in the interval between the two sampled frames, a distractor moving toward the target ends up very close to a target's location in frame 1, while the target has moved farther from its frame 1 location, then using nearest neighbor will mistakenly match the target in frame 1 with a distractor in frame 2. This is called a "false correspondence".

Using nearest-velocity matching in conjunction can help avoid false correspondences. Velocity refers to both an object's direction and its speed. Because moving objects maintain their current velocity for a few hundred milliseconds or more, depending on the display, when two objects in frame 2 are both very close to the location a target occupied in frame 1, the target is likely to be the object whose velocity is most similar to the velocity of the target in frame 1.

As was already mentioned in \@ref(serialOrParallel), it has been suggested that a moving object leaves an extended trail that lingers in sensory memory and that tracking processes operate on that representation rather than objects' instantaneous positions  [@tripathyMultipleObjectTrackingSerial2011; @howardMultipleTrajectoryTracking2012]. This is tantamount to using velocity as a feature for correspondence matching, although there does not appear to be any direct evidence for it. Still, there is evidence that the trails of moving objects, spanning about 100 ms of integration, do affect some aspects of perception [@apthorpSpatialTuningMotion2011].


@tripathyMultipleTrajectoryTracking2012 says people use trajectory information in tracking. He shows a severe capacity limit however for detecting a trajectory change.


## Velocity for position estimation

The use of nearest-velocity matching to solve the correspondence problem should be distinguished from using velocity to estimate position, in what I will call "extrapolation of the present". A velocity signal can be used to predict or extrapolate the next position of a moving object. Consider a discrete sampling situation where one has a set of sensory signals of object locations on frames 1, 2, and 3. One can use the velocity signal for a target at frame 2 to extrapolate where it should be on frame 3. Then, when the sensory signals for frame 3 arrives, one can use the extrapolated target position as the input for solving the correspondence problem rather than the frame 2 position. I call this extrapolation of the present because if the brain uses this scheme, the idea is not that a person would perceive a moving object in a potential future position. Instead, the process is one of using the trajectory a target was on to help determine which current sensory signal corresponds to it.

The experiments reviewed in the first section of this chapter found evidence for the use of motion information, but that type of evidence could not distinguish between the use of motion for extrapolating the present and the use of motion for velocity matching. As we will see next, the results from two other paradigms find little to no evidence of extrapolation, which suggests that velocity matching is the way that motion information is used.

The first paradigm that has been used to go looking for evidence of extrapolation, the "target recovery" paradigm, was developed by @keaneMotionExtrapolationEmployed2006. They had objects abruptly disappear during MOT and then reappear hundreds of milliseconds later. In their "move" conditions, they re-appeared further along the trajectory they would take had they continued with the same velocity, whereas in "non-move" conditions they would reappear in the same position they had disappeared in. Performance was uniformly worse in the move conditions than in the non-move conditions. A follow-up study by @franconeriSimpleProximityHeuristic2012 found the same result.

The possibility of extrapolation has also been explored by simply asking participants to report the last location of a target or targets after they disappear, by clicking with a mouse on the screen. If the brain extrapolates the present, that should result in participants reporting, on average, the correct last position of the target, although individual reports might be quite noisy. The brain might alternatively extrapolate the future, as has often been suggested (e.g. @nijhawanVisualPredictionPsychophysics2008), such that on average participants would click on a position ahead of a target's last position. Instead, studies have predominantly found that the locations participants report lag the final locations of the target, and this lag increases with the number of targets tracked [@howardTrackingChangingFeatures2008; @howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011]. One exception is from @iordanescuDemandbasedDynamicDistribution2009, who found that people clicked on average slightly ahead of the target's last position. However, @howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011 tried but failed to replicate this result, instead finding lags again. 

Further evidence that the visual system uses a lagged representation comes from an MOT eye-tracking study by @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016. They were able to assess whether eye position either anticipated future positions of the objects or instead lagged their present position in an ingenious model-free way. They contrasted the eye movements in pairs of trials with object paths that were identical except that their trajectories were time-reversed. After reversing the timeline of the eye movement data from the backward trials, they time-shifted that data to find the time shift that maximized the correspondence of the eye movements for the two kinds of trials. In their first and second experiment, with four targets, the time-shifting technique of @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016 revealed that eye movements lagged the targets in every participant, with a mean lag of 110 ms in the first experiment and 108 ms in the second experiment. 

Recall that a promising theory of tracking is that a process switches among the targets to update their positions - this would explain the dramatic worsening of temporal limits with additional targets reviewed in \@ref(speedAndTime). such a theory also entails that not only temporal limits, but also lags should worsen with additional targets. This is precisely what was found by @howardTrackingChangingFeatures2008 varied the number of targets from one to seven and found that the lag of the positions participants clicked on increased with the number of targets tracked. This supports a serial position sampling theory, as discussed in \@ref(serialOrParallel). However, a statistically significant increase with number of targets was not found by @howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011; they only varied the number of targets from one to three, and perhaps that was not enough. <!--@iordanescuDemandbasedDynamicDistribution2009 did not vary the number of targets to track. @corbettAttentionTwinkleGoes compared 1 vs. 4 and 1 vs. 2 targets and also didn't find sig. increase in lag, with either static or dynamic bg-->  @lukavskyGazePositionLagging2016 also investigated whether the lag changed with the number of targets, in their case the lag of eye position. In their second experiment numerically the mean lag was 15 ms less (93 ms) for two targets than for four, but this was not a statistically significant difference - the 95% confidence interval spanned from 33 ms of lag to 2 ms of extrapolation. Thus while their results were compatible with the proposition that there is less lag with fewer targets, the data did not strongly support it. More work should be done in this area.

## Simulation evidence indicates that extrapolation has little value in MOT

The evidence of the preceding sections suggests that tracking processes do little in the way of extrapolation, or even velocity matching, except for when there are only a few targets, when more limited-capacity cognitive processes may play a larger role. The paucity of evidence for extrapolation is surprising in light of the popularity of predictive frameworks for conceptualizing what the brain does. Many researchers believe that prediction is a critical component of much of perception. So, is the brain leaving a lot of performance gains on the table by not using extrapolation when there are more than a few targets?

A computational investigation by @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 found that there is little to be gained by extrapolation in standard MOT tasks. @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 took an approach resembling what is often called an "ideal observer" approach. The idea is to build into a model the relevant properties of our sensory limitations and then assess how well an optimal algorithm for processing those signals would do, and investigate how it would be affected by task parameters. @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 did this by turning a Kalman filter loose on estimating object positions for use to solve the correspondence problem in MOT. In the term "Kalman filter", the word "filter" has a tendency to mislead people, as it is not a filter in the conventional sense. The Kalman filter is instead an algorithm that learns to estimate, in Bayesian fashion, the current position of the targets. Bayesian estimation is appropriate because the sensory estimates of the objects are not precise - the simulations of @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 assume that the sensory error is Gaussian-distributed, which is a reasonable approximation, although @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 also make various simplifying assumptions, such as that the Gaussian error has the same variance throughout the visual field.

The Kalman filter makes a prediction of the object's current position, based on its best estimate of the object's last position and its velocity. This prediction, based on previous sensory position signals and a velocity estimated from them, is combined with the current sensory position signal to yield the estimate of the object's current position. The relative weights assigned to the prediction and the sensory signal are determined by an updating process that arrives at the optimal weights under certain assumptions. 

@zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 took the position estimates of the targets provided by the Kalman filter on each time step and used them to solve the correspondence problem. That is, rather than matching the sensory position data of the current frame to each sensory position datum from the previous frame believed to have been from a target, instead of this sensory data from the previous frame, they used the Kalman filter estimates of each target's position. @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 expected that simulated MOT task accuracy would be substantially higher when the Kalman filter was used, because the Kalman filter estimates of each target's position are substantially more accurate than the 'raw' sensory data.

To the surprise of the researchers, simulated MOT performance was not substantially higher for the Kalman filter than when the raw sensory data was used. This finding was robust to a range of parameter values for the simulation, so @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 concluded that extrapolation has very little benefit for the MOT tasks they investigated.

To understand this result, @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 suggested that one must first consider the situations that lead to errors in MOT. As we have suggested elsewhere in this book, most errors may arise during close encounters between targets and distractors. During the periods of an MOT trial when the targets and distractors are far from each other, there is no correspondence ambiguity and computational models such as that of @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 do not make mistakes, so extrapolation and velocity matching are certainly of no benefit there. During close encounters, by contrast, one might expect that extrapolation would reduce false correspondences. In their simulations, @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 found that extrapolation did reduce false correspondences, improving task performance but that this benefit was extremely small in size.

Why is there only a trivial benefit of extrapolation in the @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 simulations? False correspondences in the simulations are caused by noise in the incoming sensory position signals. The Kalman filter's representation is less noisy than the sensory signals, in part due to extrapolation, but the improvement in accuracy is dwarfed by the sensory noise, as far as resulting false correspondences. In other words, targets end up being swapped for distractors (false correspondence) largely due to the ambiguity in correspondence created by the sensory noise. This remained true for each of the different levels of sensory noise and intermittency of sampling that @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 simulated.

More work needs to be done with the ideal observer approach. @zhongWhyPeopleAppear2014 made some assumptions that are known to be false, such as that there is a uniform level of sensory noise across the visual field, and some that are implausible, such as that the brain can determine a global solution for the correspondence problem that minimizes the sum of the distances between the targets' position estimates provided by the Kalman filter and the new sensory observations. Probably their results would be robust to some of these assumptions, but possibly not all. 

## A cognitive extrapolation effect?

Another behavioral paradigm in which participants report the last position of an object does frequently elicit evidence of extrapolation. In this "representational momentum" paradigm, participants are typically shown only a single moving object and asked to report the object's final position after it suddenly disappears. On average, participants usually indicate a position displaced in the object's final direction of motion. @hubbardRepresentationalMomentumRelated2005 provides an extensive review of the large literature. Displacement has also been found in the direction of gravity. The phenomenon may reflect C=1 cognitive processes, but this remains uncertain because the number of objects is almost never varied in this literature. 

Another extrapolation phenomenon has been reported for frozen-action photographs that imply motion. For example, @freydMentalRepresentationMovement1983 presented a photograph such as of waves crashing on a beach, and participants judged whether a subsequently presented probe photograph was the same as the original photograph or different. The pattern of response time suggested that participants' memory of the photograph was closer to one from later in the series of photographs than the original.  @hafriMeltingIceYour2022 found that this form of extrapolation generalized to changes in state that could not easily be reduced to physical motion. For example, they found that an image of a burning log was remembered as being more burnt than it was in the original photograph.

In the literature, the term "representational momentum" is applied to both the extrapolations of the state of a stimulus like a burning log and the reported position of a moving object whose trajectory is abruptly terminated, although I don't know of strong evidence that these reflect the same phenomenon. However, it is plausible that these reflect a C≈1 process and thus would not show hallmarks of MOT such as hemifield independence. Because this sort of likely-cognitive or memorial process exists, researchers who are interested in the processes that underlie tracking should assess whether their findings can be explained by C≈1 processes before assuming that what they are studying is perceptual or attentional rather than cognitive. This issue is discussed further in the Recommendations section.

<!--I never realized that for short inter-target visits like with two targets, motion mechanisms may solve the correspondence problem, which. I never realized that the theory that predicts a linear increase in temporal limit assumes that the correspondence problem is solved like an ideal observer.
A new synthesis: the correspondence problem cannot be solved. But it could if we were extrapolating - circular trajectories would not be a problem, even if you used only the linear velocity rather than incorporating the curvature. Therefore we are not extrapolating. Are we solving the correspondence problem? If we weren't, then the motion should look degenerate, with wagon wheels happening and such.

However, subsequent work was more effective at spatially overlapping two objects, which diminished this concern [@blaserTrackingObjectFeaturespace2000].

# Speed limits and temporal limits {#speedAndTime}

Naturally there are speeds at which moving objects cannot be tracked. If we had a particular sort of brain, we'd be able to track any object whose motion we could perceive. But animal brains like ours provide for the perception of motion with a system that is quite independent of the processes that allow for tracking.

Motion direction is sensed by direction-selective cells that are arrayed in retinotopic cortex such that there are cells that respond fairly independently to motion in each part of the visual field. The responses of these cells, as they feed into higher motion-processing areas such as MT/MST, eventually give rise to the experience of motion, even though this does not seem to involve tracking. That is, these cells do not know where the object they are responding to has been previously, they are basically motion sensors that respond when there is motion of a particular direction in their receptive field.

Tracking implies the existence of some index or pointer that represents that a particular object is the same as one of the set of objects designated as targets at the beginning of the trial. Even when there is only one target, this process falters at far lower speeds than perception of the target's motion [@verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000]. Moreover, the maximum speed at which one can track is lower when there are more targets [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012]. What is it about the tracking process that gives it these properties?

An increase in object speed will have multiple consequences in a typical MOT experiment. In a standard MOT display, as the targets and distractors wander around the screen, they occasionally come very close to each other (in some experiments, they touch each other or even pass through each other). As discussed in section \@ref(spatialInterference), very close encounters can result in the loss of a target. That is relevant to the issue of speed because when MOT researchers vary object speed, they typically keep trial duration constant, so that the objects travel farther during the higher-speed trials. As a result, the objects have more close encounters, so the reason for poorer performance could simply be due to that.

A first step to revealing the effect of speed, then, is to assess it without the contaminating effect of an increase in close passes. @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 did this by by keeping the objects very far from each other as well as 
using shorter trials for fast speeds, so that objects traveled the same total distance for different speeds, just in case there were any long-distance spatial interactions. The speed thresholds that resulted were still far below those for motion perception, suggesting that speed has a deleterious effect on tracking even without any concomitant close encounters, and in a range where the simple perception of motion is yet to be affected. Moreover, participants' speed thresholds were much lower when two targets had to be tracked compared to when just one target was tracked. One way to refer to this is to say that speed consumes the tracking resource.

It is tempting to conclude that devoting more tracking resource to a target results in the associated internal pointer being able to move faster across the retina. This conclusion would be premature. There remains another possible reason that tracking falters at high speeds.

## A temporal limit on perception

When two objects appear in a common location very close in time, they will be combined by the visual system. If one flickers a light off and on at a very rapid rate (about 60 times a second, depending upon display characteristics), the flicker will not be perceived; instead, one perceives the average of the dark and light phases. That is, the individual on-phases of the light cannot be perceived due to their temporal proximity with the off-phases. This is the basis of projection in the cinema, and is the reason that you can't perceive the flicker of the long tube-style fluorescent lights that fill the ceilings of old office buildings.

The same phenomenon occurs with moving objects, as Ptolemy noted in his *Optics*, a book written almost two thousand years ago. Viewing a rapidly rotating potter's wheel inspired Ptolemy to write, "If spots of a color different from that of the disc are marked on it, they will appear to form circles of the same color [as the given spot] when the disc is rapidly spun."  He also noted that "This also happens in the case of shooting stars, whose light seems distended on account of their speed of motion, all according to the amount of perceptible distance it passes along with the sensible impression that arises in the visual faculty" [@smithPtolemyTheoryVisual1996]. Ptolemy was correct to suggest that these phenomena are caused by our "visual faculty" rather than the physics of light. Our visual systems combine photoreceptor activations that occur in a single location within a certain amount of time, resulting in the perception of trails behind shooting stars.

While the temporal blurring that fuses together the flickering phases of a fluorescent light, the different colors on a potter's wheel, and the successive locations of a shooting star reflects the temporal resolution of early stages of our visual system, later stages of visual processing also have temporal limits.

## Temporal limits on visual cognition

```{r redRightGreenLeft, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="Task: judge whether the red color is paired with leftward tilt or rightward title."}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/binding/colorgrdnt2_9fps.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/binding/colorgrdnt2_2fpsStatic.png")
```

In the above display, one can easily perceive that the color is alternating between green and red, and that the contour on the left is alternating rapidly between leftward tilt and rightward tilt. This means that the alternation rate does not exceed the temporal resolution of the early visual system - if it did, you would perceive just one color (yellow or brown).

Nevertheless, it is very difficult or impossible to judge which color, red or green, is presented at the same time as the leftward tilt [@holcombeEarlyBindingFeature2001]. When the animation is slowed to a rate much slower than about 200 ms per stimulus presentation however, the task becomes quite easy, as you can see below. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="Task: judge whether the red color is paired with leftward tilt or rightward title."}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/binding/colorgrdnt2_2fpsCONVERTED.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/binding/colorgrdnt2_2fpsStatic.png")
```

In the first movie, the temporal resolution of one's ability to pair the features was exceeded. The temporal dissociation here, and in other circumstances, between perceiving individual features and perceiving their pairing suggests that feature binding requires processes that take longer (have coarser temporal resolution) than those that provide perception of the individual features [@holcombeSeeingSlowSeeing2009; @fujisakiCommonPerceptualTemporal2010b].

In the above example, it is tempting to suggest that the dissociation results from a need to make a spatial shift of attention from one of the features' locations to the other in order to identify both before the other features are presented. <!--However, evidence from rapid serial visual presentation indicates that--> However, the phenomenon can also occur with spatially superposed features, such as in the case of color and motion below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="Task: For each row, judge whether the dots, when white, are moving to the left or to the right."}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/binding/Movie2_Binding3speeds40fpsCONVERTED.gif")
```

While at the slow rate of the top row, it is easy to judge the pairing of motion direction and white/black color, it is very difficult in the middle row, where the speed is slightly faster. 

The first to suggest this sort of thing reflected a general limit on temporal individuaation was Dutch guy



attend to the location of one feature first to identify it and 
the colors and then of the 

This phenomenon can also occur for features that are superposed.

not something specific to features

Thus, while early visual processing can deliver motion and color features even from stimuli that are temporally very close to each other, the processing required to judge which features are at the same time requires processing that fails when temporal proximity is very high 

## Low-level and high-level temporal limits {#loHighLevelLims}

In the previous two sections I pointed out that while we can perceive the flicker in a rapidly changing light at rates as high as 60 Hz, some feature binding judgments begin to fail at 3 Hz. @holcombeSeeingSlowSeeing2009 reviewed all the known temporal limits on human visual judgments, from flicker to binocular depth and motion as well as the binding of various features. These limits clustered into two groups, with one set of tasks limited to 8 Hz or below and another set with limits substantially greater than 8 Hz. The summary figure below, based on one in @holcombeSeeingSlowSeeing2009 but with the addition of more recent evidence, highlights these two groups.

The percepts limited to slow rates are likely to be computed by specialized perceptual mechanisms, whereas those limited to slow rates may require attentional selection and possibly parietal or temporal cortex to bind together two of the constituent features. This idea is schematized in Figure \@ref(fig:slowFastBoxesArrows).

## Temporal limits on tracking

Where does object tracking fit into the above-reviewed temporal limits on visual judgments? A good starting point to understand is the ambiguous apparent motion depicted in the "higher-order motion" part of Figure \@ref(fig:slowFastBoxesArrows). If those two frames are alternated, one can see apparent motion clockwise or counter-clockwise. Which direction one sees depends on attention - one can actually choose to see the figure to rotate clockwise or to rotate counter-clockwise [@wertheimerExperimentelleStudienUber1912]. @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 found that the maximum alternation rate at which this could be done was between 4 and 8 Hz. The temporal frequency here is the rate at which a dot is presented at a location.
In addition to this test of 2-frame apparent motion, they also presented unambiguous apparent motion by adding intermediate frames in between the the two original frames, in either the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. This increased the maximum temporal frequency for each of three participants, but not to any higher than 8 Hz.

Importantly, these findings are not specific to jumpy apparent motion displays. @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 found a similar result with continuous motion of a grating, where temporal frequency reflects how often a bright (or dark) bar of the grating traverses any one location. Specifically, they used a circular sine-wave grating presented in an annulus. Participants fixated in the center, attempted to covertly track one light bar of the grating that was cued at the beginning of the trial, and performance fell to 75% correct when the time between successive light bars of the grating was shorter than about 150 milliseconds (6.7 Hz) for the best of the three participants and about 238 ms (4 Hz) for the worst of the three.

<!--That is, *spatial* close encounters aren't the only thing that happen more frequently with higher object speeds. *Temporal* close encounters also happen more frequently. By temporal close encounter, I mean a situation where both an object and a distractor visit the same spatial region in a short span of time.

While the concept of temporal close encounters, or temporal proximity, is not something that attention researchers are familiar with in the context of moving objects,

In an MOT display, as an object moves on from a particular location, that location will sometimes be occupied soon after by another of the moving objects. Unfortunately the processing of the first object at that location may not be completed before the second object replaces it.

The inter-object intervals at a location will be long at slow object speeds and with wide spacing among objects. At high object speeds, however, these intervals can be short even if objects are widely spaced. .-->

@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 found a similar result using discs rather than a grating - with 6 participants, once the discs were moving fast enough that two visited a location within 150 ms (6.6 Hz), tracking performance fell to a similar criterion (halfway to chance) as that used by @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000.

You can get a taste of this, first view the below movie, fixating on the dot in the center, and try to track the two targets that are initially white. If the movie isn't displayed properly, view it [here](movies/MOTmovies/temporalLimits/2targets3objectsPerArray.gif).
 When the movie is at its beginning (when the speed readout at top right indicates 0.02 rps), one object in each of the two rings is drawn in white. These are the targets for you to track while you keep your gaze fixed on the dot in the center. As the speed gradually increases, try to keep tracking and see how fast it goes before you lose the targets.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Task: fixate the white dot, track the initially-white targets, and note how fast you can track, using the speed in the upper right corner."}

Many people can track the targets even at the movie's fastest speed of approximately 0.6 rps (the exact speed it reached depends on your computer). This is to be expected, because at 0.6 rps, 3 objects corresponds to a an inter-object interval of 556 milliseconds, far higher than the temporal limit. The situation is quite different, however, for the below movie. If the movie isn't displayed properly, view it [here](movies/MOTmovies/temporalLimits/2targets9objectsPerArray.gif).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Fixate on the dot in the center, track the two targets that are initially white, and note the speed at which you are no longer able to track."}

This movie uses the same speeds as the previous one. The only difference is that eight distractors are presented in each array instead of two. In this case people find that as the objects accelerate, very quickly they feel that they can no longer track the objects. Note that this is not due to spatial interference - only when the number of equidistant objects in an array exceeds 13 will spatial interference become significant [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013, p.11; @toetTwodimensionalShapeSpatial1992; @pelliUncrowdedWindowObject2008].

Another way to think about temporal frequency limits such as this is that they reflect when temporal interference becomes strong due to close encounters in time. That is, just as increasing the spatial density of a display high enough will impair tracking due to spatial interference (crowding), a more dense display will also mean a higher temporal frequency, with an object and a distractor visiting the same spatial region in a short span of time.

This brings me to how @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 and @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 established that the limit is a temporal one rather than a speed limit. They relied on the fact that a particular temporal frequency corresponds to different combinations of speed and spatial density, rather than a single speed as one would expect from a speed limit. The space-time diagrams in Figure \@ref(fig:temporalResltnSushi) schematizes this, using the height of a pink rectangle to represent the temporal resolution of the tracking processes. At low stimulus speed and density the time between stimuli occupying any one spatial location is long, so tracking succeeds (top panel). When one increases either speed (middle panel) or density (lower panel), the interval between visits to each location decreases.

```{r temporalResltnSushi, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="The purple rectangle represents the spatial resolution (width) and temporal resolution (height) of tracking. Top panel: The space-time diagram schematizes a sushi train where one piece of sushi is designated as the target. Both density (number of sushi pieces) and speed is low. Tracking is possible because tracking is able to select a single piece of sushi. Middle panel: At medium speed, despite low density, tracking fails because temporal resolution is exceeded.  Bottom panel: At low speed but medium density, tracking fails because temporal resolution is exceeded."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/spatialTempResltnSushi/temporalResltnSushi.jpeg")
```

Quantitatively, the rate of stimulation of each location is the product of speed and density. For a circular array, then, temporal frequency equals speed (in revolutions per second) times the number of discs in the circular array. This means that a temporal limit provides a quantitative prediction for the speed and density combinations that will correspond to participants' thresholds. This prediction was confirmed by the aforementioned studies. @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013, for example, used four different inter-object spacings and many different speeds (speeds were adjusted by a staircase) to assess the speed threshold for each object spacing. The thresholds across the different spacings were close to that predicted by a 6.6 Hz limit. In a study discussed in more detail later, @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017 replicated this finding that thresholds were more consistent with a temporal frequency limit than with a speed limit - they tested two different spacings and found that the corresponding thresholds were more similar when expressed as temporal frequency than as speed.

<!--But how did they (and @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000) establish that this was caused by temporal interference rather than spatial interference or a speed limit? They capitalized on the contrasting predictions by these three phenomena when object spacing and speed are both manipulated. 

With the circular array of equally-spaced objects used by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013, the amount of time between objects traveling over any one location is the inverse of the product of the speed and the number of objects in the array. For example, if there are four objects in the array moving at 1.75 revolutions per second, then an object will cross any given location in the circular trajectory every 140 milliseconds. Therefore, if temporal interference occurs when objects are in a location within 140 milliseconds of each other, the speed threshold for eight objects in an array should be much slower - 0.875 revolutions per second. This is indeed what was found by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013, for three different objects-per-array conditions.-->

The figure below summarises what we know about the limits on covertly tracking a single target. 

```{r singleTargetLimits, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Spatial and temporal limits on covertly tracking one object. UPDATE THIS IMAGE WITH BETTER NUMBERS IF REVIEWERS/EDITOR APPROVE OF THE FIGURE, including starting crowding at 13"}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/trackingLimitsMotionLimitSchematic.png")
```

Based on the studies to date, the temporal frequency limit seems to vary substantially between different participants, but 7 Hz is near the top of the range and is used for Figure \@ref(fig:singleTargetLimits). For a circular array, 7 Hz corresponds to lower and lower speeds when more and more distractors are in the array. Note that these speeds are far, far below those that correspond to the limit on motion perception documented for drifting gratings - 25 Hz [@burrContrastSensitivityHigh1982]. Spatial crowding likely imposes another limit on tracking [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014; @intriligatorSpatialResolutionVisual2001], at a point far lower than the spatial acuity limit (not shown). Finally, as we will describe in the "Speed limits" section below, an actual speed limit (as opposed to a temporal limit) also seems to constrain tracking. The combination of these limits yields the combinations of speeds and number of distractors in a circular array indicated by the pink region.

These findings suggest an individuation limit wherein if a stimulus repeats at a particular location within a certain amount of time, about 120 ms if the limit is 8 Hz, the processes responsible for tracking fail. While they never studied tracking, @vandegrindTemporalTransferProperties1973 anticipated this phenomenon to some extent. They coined the term "Gestalt fusion" to refer to how they saw the two phases of a flickering light as being perceived as a single thing when the flicker rate was above approximately 7 Hz. If this is an individuation limit, it might possibly have broader consequences than simply limiting tracking. It might be the reason for some or all of the other slow temporal limits reviewed in \@ref(loHighLevelLims) above. Before considering  that in detail, however, an important property that we have not discussed is how resource-intensive the temporal limit on tracking is.

## Temporal interference is highly resource-intensive

In addition to replicating the finding of @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 of an approximately 7 Hz limit on attentional tracking, @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 also investigated the limits on tracking with two targets and with three targets. They found that the temporal limit was markedly worse for higher target loads. Specifically, while when tracking one target, `r round(1000/7)` ms had to elapse between when a target and a distractor visited a location (7 Hz), for two targets the threshold was about `r round(1000/4.2)` ms, and for three targets it was about `r round(1000/2.6)` ms. This dramatic effect of target load on temporal limit was replicated by @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017, who also replicated the finding that these thresholds were more consistent with a temporal frequency limit than with a speed limit.

The effect of target load on temporal limit observed by @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017 was remarkably similar in size to the large effect found by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013. The eight participants tested by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 were all relatively young men, apart from two young women. @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017 tested both old and young participants, and reported a statistically significant difference. Among their young group, however, they tested only nine young men and nine young women, which for most known gender differences would be provide low statistical power, so the finding of a gender difference should be considered provisional. <!--I do not discuss or show the results they found for their old (greater than 60 years) group because that group included many outliers with very low performance.  ACTUALLY NO BAD OUTLIERS AMONG OLD FOR 1 AND 2 TARGETS SO MAYBE INCLUDE THAT-->

In each of the four datasets plotted (and also in the data from the old participants excluded because of outliers), the temporal limit decreases dramatically with increasing target load. Of all the effects of increasing target load that we have discussed, this one may be the largest.

Attentional tracking is a complex task - in section \@ref(whichAspects), six factors likely to affect tracking performance were listed. However, some of these factors might affect practically any task; it is those that are most resource-intensive, and thus most limit our capacity, that should be most illuminating for understanding tracking processes.

From the rather unconstrained trajectories used in most MOT studies, researchers were unable to make strong inferences about how target load was adversely affecting performance. For example, it was necessary to carefully control the distances between objects to disconfirm the suggestion that spatial interference even beyond the crowding range was the primary determinant of the effect of tracking load [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014; @holcombeCommentCapacityLimits2019]. In displays where objects come very close to each other, spatial interference may yet be a big reason for the performance decrease with target load, we **just don't know yet**.

For temporal interference, the evidence is strong that it is dramatically increased by target load. This leads to two important questions. The first is: what does this effect tell us about how tracking works? Discussion of this is deferred to the \@ref(serialOrParallel) section, but in short, it supports serial switching theories of tracking.

The second question is: what role does temporal interference play in typical MOT displays that use more linear trajectories? Unfortunately, none appear to have done so for temporal interference. And some of the evidence from studies that set out to investigate the role of spatial proximity might alternatively be explained by temporal proximity [e.g., @baeCloseEncountersDistracting2012]- in typical MOT displays, spatial proximity is likely to be highly correlated with temporal proximity. 

<!--MENTION THAT THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE ATTENTION DOES FEEL LIKE IT CAN BE LEFT BEHIND AS AN OBJECT MOVES ON (IN THE OBJECTS CHAPTER I SAID THAT ATTENTION FEELS PULLED ALONG BY A MOVING OBJECT)-->

## Relation to other temporal limits

A plausible interpretation of the temporal limit on tracking is that it is an attentional selection individuation limit. Above the limit, stimuli cannot be individually selected by attention for processing by higher-level, limited-capacity processes such as cognition. This could prevent successful performance of many, or all, of the tasks in the slow group of Figure \@ref(fig:temporalLims). For example, to correctly identify that red is paired with leftward-tilted in \@ref(fig:redRightGreenLeft), both the color and the orientation have to be identified. If attention is unable to select an individual color and orientation and instead has access only to two or more successive frames, then from the perspective of higher-level processes, both colors and both shapes were essentially presented simultaneously. This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:temporalresolutionwaterworks).

```{r temporalresolutionwaterworks, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="A rapidly alternating color-orientation pairing stimulus (top) is processed first by high temporal resolution feature processors, which independently determine the color and orientation. Subsequently the pairing of the two features is determined by a process that, because it is low temporal resolution, unfortunately 'sees' multiple colors and orientations simultaneously."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/temporalLimitsPerception/temporalresolutionwaterworks.png")
```

While the temporal limit on binding for this and related tasks is less than 3 Hz [@holcombeEarlyBindingFeature2001; @arnoldPerceptualPairingColour2005], the tracking limit for one target is significantly higher, close to 7 Hz \@ref(fig:trackingLimitsReview). The reason for this may be that while both tasks require individuation, the binding tasks require additional processing such as labeling of the features [@holcombeEarlyBindingFeature2001; @fujisakiCommonPerceptualTemporal2010]. This theory is consistent with the evidence reviewed in  \@ref(identity) that encoding of features (such as color or orientation) does not occur in basic tracking. The successive locations of a tracked object must be paired, but this may be faster than other forms of binding, both because feature encoding is not required and possibly because it may piggy-back on motion perception.

@marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013 investigated the role of motion mechanisms with an adaptation experiment in which participants were exposed to a prolonged period of either slow or fast motion. Exposure to slow motion decreased the participants' maximum tracking speed, while exposure to fast motion actually increased it. Note that this is opposite in direction to what one might expect from other instances of sensory adaptation, wherein adaptation to high spatial frequency, for example, *reduces* the maximum spatial frequency one can perceive, which is thought to be because the underlying mechanism becomes less responsive.

@marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013 theorized that this surprising effect reflected changes in the relative contribution of the two types of spatiotemporal filters thought to mediate speed perception. Specifically, @marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013 suggested that the low-pass filters are needed to individuate a target from the distractors, because, they said, only the low-pass filters have small enough receptive fields. On that basis, adaptation to slow motion reduces the temporal limit on tracking. They further proposed that adapting to fast motion adapts the band-pass temporal frequency filters that, being large, tend to group the target with the distractors, and thus reducing their responsiveness is a good thing. This account seems plausible for the stimulus they used, as the moving discs were quite close to each other, as there were twelve of them sharing the circular trajectory. I am not sure whether the same can be said if there were only six discs in the trajectory. Unfortunately @marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013 did not test this. They also did not test whether the speed limit, as opposed to the temporal limit, was changed by adaptation; this could be investigated by using two or three discs in the circular trajectory. The finding of @marinovicAttentionaltrackingAcuityModulated2013 is an important one as further investigation seems likely to provide additional insights.

<!--An increase in close encounters isn't the only consequence of higher speeds in a standard MOT trial. At least, close encounters in *space* isn't the only consequence. There's another sort of close encounter, one that most people aren't familiar with, the *temporal* close encounter.

Spatial resolution is fine, as you can see from blah blah blah.
-->

<!--OUTSTANDING QUESTION: Is it the distractor replacing the target that's worse or the target invading the former distractor location? -->

## Speed limits

We have seen that the apparent speed limits on tracking in dense displays may actually be caused by temporal limits. This is because when there are a lot of objects in a display, at high object speeds both targets and distractors may occupy a particular location within three or four hundred milliseconds, which can impair or prevent tracking. Temporal interference is less of an issue when the targets and distractors are kept very far apart from each other. 

When using a circular trajectory with just one target and one distractor on opposite sides, such that the distractor did not replace the target very quickly, @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 found evidence that tracking was truly limited by speed rather than by temporal interference. What this was that the maximum speed at which participants could track was much lower than what was predicted by the 7 Hz limit found when several distractors shared the circular trajectory with the target. With one target and one distractor, the 7 Hz limit should result in a speed threshold of  3.5 revolutions per second. Instead, participants' thresholds were on average less than 2 revolutions per second. My lab found a very similar result [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013]. When we tested with 5, 8, or 12 distractors, the speed limit was close to that predicted by a 7 Hz temporal limit. But when there were only 2 distractors in the array, the average speed limit was only 1.7 rps, rather than 3.5 rps predicted by a 7 Hz limit.

It seems, then that tracking of a single object is limited both by a speed limit of about 2 revolutions per second and by a temporal limit of about 7 Hz. The computer screens that were used for testing had refresh rates of 160 Hz, and when the speed of an object is very fast, one can see gaps between the successive frames, which conceivably could be contributing to the speed limit. However, when Wei-Ying Chen and I used a mechanical device rather than an intermittent computer display, we found a speed limit that was only slightly faster, about 2.3 rps [@holcombeSpeedLimitAttentional].

Changing the radius of the circular trajectory in experiments like these yielded a truly remarkable finding. Well, @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 mentioned that for their experiments where participants had to track one bar of a circular 2-cycle grating, they also informally tested annular gratings of different sizes. When the grating was larger, the length of the path traveled by the bar when making one revolution was, of course, longer. One would therefore expect that the speed threshold, when expressed in revolutions per second, should decrease in proportion to the radius of the grating. Consider that a grating of radius 2 deg has twice the circumference as that of a 1 deg radius grating, so the revolutions per second should be halved in order for a bar to travel the same distance in the same amount of time. However, @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 said that they saw no change in the speed limit in terms of rps. That is, participants could track an object moving twice as fast when the trajectory had a larger radius. 

Wei-Ying Chen and I also found that the speed threshold, when expressed in revolutions per second, was robust to the increases in length of the trajectory associated with larger radii [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012], despite the substantial increase in speed in terms of linear distance traveled. <!--Establishing such invariances is fundamental to scientific explanation (e.g. @woodwardExplanationInvarianceSpecial2000), and this particular near-invariance rules against naïve expectations of how speed exerts its effect.--> We will therefore refer to the speed limit as an angular speed limit.

What does this mean for the processes that underlie tracking? Conceivably, the limit could be imposed by the *cortical* distance traveled, as the amount of retinotopic cortex per deg of visual angle may diminish linearly with eccentricity. However, for the limit to stay close to constant would require that the scaling constant be equal to one, but empirically this does not seem to be the case, based both on psychophysical and physiological measures [@strasburgerPeripheralVisionPattern2011]. Another possibility is we might call the costly hemifield-crossing theory. Doubling the revolutions per second doubles the rate of crossing the vertical meridian, and crossing that meridian is known to impair tracking [@strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020]. If so, a faster limit should be found for trajectories that do not cross the vertical meridian, but in an unpublished experiment [@holcombeSpeedLimitAttentional], this was not found. Finally, @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 suggested that the limit may coincide with that found for mental rotation of objects [@cooperMentalTransformationsVisual1976], so possibly the same processes limit both. <!--@holcombeSpeedLimitAttentional compared circular to linear trajectories, by having the objects travel along a diamond-shaped trajectory rather than a circle. Nine participants were tested. The mean speed threshold was 1.2 rps for both conditions. -->

Other than @verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000 and myself and Chen, no tracking researchers appear to have grappled with the angular speed limit, or mentioned it in any published papers. Instead, MOT researchers continue to write as if tracking is limited by linear distance traveled per unit time, not by revolutions per second or by temporal interference. Admittedly, the speed limit may have little effect in conventional MOT displays with linear trajectories, because for the speeds tested in all or practically all such experiments, objects probably take longer than a second to ever move a full revolution around a point in the display. However, many recent papers use circular trajectories, where the angular speed limit may come into play, although again they tend to use speeds slower than 1 rps [e.g. @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021, @carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007].

Is the angular speed limit caused by a more structural limitation, what @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 called data-limited, or is it resource intensive like the temporal frequency limit? If it is resource intensive, the speed limit should be lower when more targets are tracked, as that would result in less resource available per target. @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 did document an associated decline in speed thresholds, from 1.7 rps with one target to 1.2 rps with two targets and 0.8 rps with three targets. Unfortunately, however, it is difficult to discern whether this reduction is due to a reduction in the actual speed limit, or instead was caused by the previously-documented decline in temporal frequency limit. The problem is that the temporal frequency limit with two targets (approximately 4 Hz) corresponds to a speed, with three objects in a trajectory, below that of the one-target speed limit, so it is difficult to know whether the speed threshold reflects a decline in both the temporal limit and the speed limit or just the temporal limit.

Using fMRI, @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 investigated the brain areas associated with multiple object tracking, and varied objects' speeds. If higher speeds consumed more of the tracking resource, one might expect that higher speeds would increase the activation in the same areas that increase in activation with more targets. @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 identified a parietal region that increased in activation with the number of targets. However, there was no increase in activation of any parietal area with target speed. In a whole-brain analysis, however, @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 did find some scattered voxels whose activity increased with speed, including the frontal eye field, which is often associated with attentional tasks. @howeUsingFMRIDistinguish2009 also found strong FEF activation in MOT. They did not vary speed, but did compare tracking moving targets to monitoring targets that were stationary, and found that that comparison also yielded strong FEF activation. They suggested that given the FEF's involvement in eye movements, the activation might reflect suppression of eye movements. Although they did not cite any evidence that suppression of eye movements is more demanding for tracked moving targets than for monitored stationary targets, that seems highly plausible.

<!--@holcombeSpeedLimitAttentional found a speed limit of 2.2 rps with one distractors and 1.8 rps with two distractors-->

<!--Some of the studies that documented hemifield independence used a target moving on a small circular trajectory together shared by a single distractor [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @chenResourceDemandsObject2013]. If these trajectories had been centered on the fixation point, we know that the speed thresholds would be determined  by the speed limit. But they're always looking at 2 versus 1 target so it could be caused by temporal frequency limit anyway

. First, they showed that objects' speeds could be increased until a tracking "speed limit" (68% threshold) where performance tracking two targets was approximately that predicted if participants could only track one of the two targets and had to guess about the other. They then examined the effect of adding a target to the other hemifield rather than the same hemifield. Performance in that condition was very close to that predicted i

. at high speeds (at the 68% threshold), a high degree of hemifield independence was found - a mean of 75% independence but with enough uncertainty to make it compatible with 100% independence. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 of @chenResourceDemandsObject2013 used the same approach, but compared tracking two targets unilaterally and bilaterally to tracking four targets. Across E1 and E2 the average of the speed thresholds the numbers suggest approximately 100% hemifield independence (with a lot of uncertainty in the estimate).-->

## Putting it all together

The temporal interference and associated temporal limits on tracking are clearly highly resource-intensive. Tracking three targets rather than one almost triples the severity of the temporal limit.  We will discuss the theoretical implications in a subsequent section. Tracking is also constrained by a speed limit, but we do not yet know whether the speed limit decreases with more targets or is instead a fixed limit. We also do not understand the nature of the speed limit - whether it is truly a rotational limit and how it relates to other mental processes.

# Two brains or one? {#twoBrains}

A human brain can be thought of as made up of two brains, a left and a right, just as we have two legs and two hands. 
<!--While an industry of education consultants and "brain training" companies exploits  common left brain, right brain misconceptions,  
We all have a "left brain" and a "right brain", which have different learning styles, and they should be trained both separately and in a way that gets them communicating with each other. Or so many would have you believe. The anatomical division of the hemispheres has been hyped into a supposed plethora of implications for behavior and learning. A veritable industry of education consultants and "brain training" providers have peddled these ideas, selling programs they refer to as, for example, "left brain versus right brain" training [@kroezeBrainGymPseudoscientific2016].--> Much of sensory and perceptual processing is very specific to the two halves of the cortex, but more cognitive functions such as declarative memory benefit from a very tight integration. Indeed, this integration is extensive enough that the comparison of our two hemispheres to our two hands is misleading.

Our conscious experience, too, is highly unified. We experience no discontinuity when the movement of our eyes, or of an object, cause an object to shift from one hemifield, where it is processed predominantly by one hemisphere, to the other hemifield. Communication between the two hemispheres happens rapidly and continuously, and there is no good evidence that exercises designed to insure both hemispheres process stimuli have any benefit for learning. 

In "split-brain" patients, many of the connections between the hemispheres have been lost. Despite the loss of these connections, such patients can still perform visual search in both hemifields, indicating that both hemispheres have the capacity to do that task. Indeed, when split-brain patients are asked to search for a target among many distractor objects, spreading the load by distributing the distractors across the two hemifields can yield a large benefit, suggesting that the two hemispheres in these patients carry out their searches independently [@luckIndependentAttentionalScanning1994a]. For intact individuals, no such advantage is seen, suggesting that the processes that evaluate each stimulus for whether it is the target are integrated across the hemispheres into a single attentional focus [@luckIndependentHemisphericAttentional1989].

While performance in search and other behaviors typically shows a tight inter-hemispheric integration, the two hemispheres do specialize for certain functions. The left hemisphere specializes in language functions such as reading, while the right hemisphere is better at recognizing faces. A behavioral consequence of this is that response times for a face recognition task are slightly faster when the stimulus is presented wholly in the left hemifield (to the right hemisphere) than when it is presented wholly in the right hemifield, whereas the opposite is found for word reading [@rizzolattiOppositeSuperioritiesRight1971]. However, with extended time to process a stimulus, such behavioral asymmetries can disappear as the information from one hemisphere is communicated to the other.

In the performance of most perceptual and attentional tasks, then, in humans with an intact brain there is little sign that that brain is divided into two halves. Multiple object tracking, however, constitutes a major exception to this. This tells us that the limited resource that determines how many objects one can keep track of resides largely with a process that operates independently in the two hemispheres.

In 2005, George Alvarez & Patrick Cavanagh reported a stunning finding. In an MOT task, they used objects that resembled spinning pinwheels. An individual bar of each object could be designated as a target. Performance in a two-target (one bar of each of two different pinwheels) condition was contrasted with that  for a one-target condition [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005].  When the second target was positioned in the same hemifield as the first target, accuracy in the two-target condition was much worse (89% vs. 63%). Remarkably, however, when the second target belonged to a pinwheel located in the opposite hemifield, there was very little performance decrement - accuracy was 93% in the one-target condition, and 90% correct in the two-target condition. This suggests that the processes that limit successful tracking in this task are largely specific to each hemifield. 

It was already known that sensory processing and quite a lot of perceptual processing occurs independently in each hemisphere. What is surprising is that a highly limited-capacity processing ability would be hemisphere-independent. Such capacities were traditionally thought to be among the processes that are tightly integrated across the two hemispheres, forming a single resource "pool", not two independent limits. We will get back to this point, first we'll examine more extensively the evidence for hemispheric independence of object tracking.

The hemispheric independence of a task can be quantified. Imagine that adding a second stimulus to a hemifield reduces performance by 20 percentage points, but adding that stimulus to the other hemifield reduces performance by only 5 percentage points. One can quantify the hemispheric independence, then, as (20-5) / 20 = 75% hemifield independence. Ideally, however, one would not use raw accuracy but instead would correct for the accuracy one can achieve by guessing. When [applying such a calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd) to the @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 results, the estimated level of independence is very high: `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE1Independence)`% independence in one of their experiments, and `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE3Independence)`% in the other. 

@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 themselves, like most others who have investigated this question, did not do these calculations. @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 calculated expected performance if the hemifields are in fact completely independent, and reported that performance was not statistically significantly worse than that figure. They then suggested that there was complete independence, but this is based on the common fallacy of concluding a null hypothesis is true when the evidence does not reject it at a p<.05 level [@aczelQuantifyingSupportNull2018]. That is, for the null hypothesis they started with their conclusion of complete independence, and then affirmed this conclusion on the basis of not finding much evidence against it. Nevertheless, their data do suggest hemispheric independence of approximately 90%. In a study with similar methods, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 found `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence (they did not calculate a number, so this is [my calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)).

Some of the follow-up studies in this area have not included enough conditions to quantify the degree of independence, or confounded distribution of the targets to two hemifields with greater distance among them, such that any benefit might have been due to less spatial crowding interference, a phenomenon discussed in section \@ref(spatialInterference).

@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @chenResourceDemandsObject2013 found similar results with a slightly different approach based on speed thresholds, which are discussed in section \@ref(speedAndTime). The findings were compatible with approximately 100% hemifield independence or a bit less. @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010<!--Figure 1--> and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 also found evidence for a substantial bilateral advantage compared to adding a target in the same hemifield. 

These findings of hemispheric independence has not replicated in all circumstances [e.g., @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008] <!--performance in all the conditions involved in their comparison were greater than 85% correct, including many low speeds where performance was near ceiling -->  <!--For most of these tasks, but not @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010, more targets was confounded with having to make more responses and remember said responses at the end of the trial, so some of the residual cost could be due to that being unitary rather than hemifield-specific.-->, but the successful replications strongly suggest that at least in some circumstances, tracking does occur mostly independently in the two hemispheres. I say "mostly independently" rather than suggesting complete independence because each individual study has too much statistical uncertainty to rule out a figure such as 75% independence, even when its mean suggests a higher degree of independence.

@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 suggested that the reason they did not find evidence for hemifield independence is that they used only two targets, whereas according to them the original @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 report of hemifield independence used four targets. This is unlikely to be the reason for the discrepancy, however, because in their E1 and E2 @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 did find evidence for hemifield independence using just two targets, as did @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014. The @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 data may have been afflicted by a ceiling effect, as accuracy was over 85% correct in all conditions in their experiment. 

<!-- Shim, Alvarez, & Jiang (2008) found no advantage for targets in different hemifields. Why? Not sure, but the objects weren’t spaced far enough part to not crowd each other across the hemifield boundaries. In contrast, Shim et al. and Bello et al. suggest it was because hemifield limit doesn’t apply when just two targets. Holcombe & Chen found it did, but Bello suggests the reason is that we used circular trajectories that are somehow different, they say you can extrapolate more with them, whereas it may be that you can extrapolate less.   The target-target distance effect in Shim et al. is huge! How do I explain that? One possible explanation is Carlson’s quadrantic deficit.-->

A limitation of deriving hemispheric independence from accuracy is that they depend on the assumption that if a person can only track one target, if one then adds a second target, the person will succeed just as often in tracking one of them. But my introspective experience indicates that in some circumstances, if one tries to track both targets, one will fail at both, and thus one is better off only trying to track one. The reason for this may be that a certain amount of resource is needed to track a target, and so if neither target is allocated that much resource, tracking will fail for both. Evidence for this was provided by @chenResourceDemandsObject2013. In the terminology introduced by @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975, the resource function that relates the proportion of attentional resource to accuracy falls below a straight line. This means that quantitative estimates of hemispheric independence will be overestimates, particularly in circumstances where the participants do not realize they may be better off focusing their efforts on tracking fewer targets than the number they have been told to track.

@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007 found evidence not only for hemifield independence but also quadrant-level independence, which they attributed to the partial separation of the retinotopic quadrant representations in areas V2 and V3. Using different stimuli, @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 and @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did not, however, find evidence for this: they did not find evidence for a deficit when two targets were positioned in the same quadrant compared to different quadrants but in the same hemifield. More work on this topic should be done.

## Some tracking resources are NOT hemifield-specific

A previous section introduced the idea of C=1 cognitive processes that can support tracking of a single target but perhaps not multiple targets. Such processing likely is not hemisphere-specific. <!--We easily attend to objects in any part of the visual field, left or right.-->  Feature attention, for example attention to color, is a case in point. When a participant is told to look for a red target, they are able to use feature attention to enhance all red objects, no matter where they are in the visual field [@whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011]. The decision to look for red originates with cognitive processes and remains hemifield-unified rather than hemifield-specific even at the level of visual cortex [@saenzGlobalEffectsFeaturebased2002]. Indeed, people seem to be unable to confine the enhancement of red objects to one hemifield [@loHowWeSelect2014].

@chenResourceDemandsObject2013 found evidence for both hemifield-specific processes and processes not specific to a hemifield in the same MOT task. Two targets that sometimes had different speeds were used. When a slow-moving target was paired with a speedier target, accuracy was lower for the slow-moving target than if it was paired with a target that was slower. This suggests that participants allocate more tracking resources to the faster of two targets, presumably because slower targets do not require much resource to track well. This trade-off was most pronounced when the two targets were in the same hemifield, but seemed to occur to some degree even when the two targets were in different hemifields, implicating a cross-hemifield resource that plays a small role. This cross-hemifield resource may be a C=1 process. Most cognitive tasks are unlikely to be independently mediated by the two hemispheres, with one set of processes in each hemisphere.

Finally, as discussed in the next section, perturbing one parietal lobe can affect performance in both hemifields, which suggests that each hemisphere can in some circumstances mediate tracking in either hemifield.

## The underlying mechanisms

The evidence reviewed above for hemifield independence suggests that hemisphere-specific processes determine how many targets one can track. This raises the question of what sort of processes those are, and how they interact with the cognitive processes that are more integrated across the hemispheres.

Steve Franconeri and colleagues have championed the idea that the hemisphere independence stems from spatial interference processes, by suggesting that these processes occur largely within a hemisphere [@franconeriNatureStatusVisual2013]. The idea is that when when an object is tracked, the neurons representing that target in retinotopic cortical areas activate inhibitory connections to nearby neurons in the cortical map, suppressing the responses to neighboring objects [@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007. To explain the findings of hemifield specificity, what's been added to this account is the idea that the inhibitory neural connections do not extend from one hemisphere's retinotopic map to another [@franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013]. The evidence that as manifest in classic crowding tasks, spatial interference does show a discontinuity across the left- and right-visual field boundary lends some plausibility to this idea [@liuReductionCrowdingEffect2009]. However, @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 found evidence against spatial interference extending any further than the classic crowding range , which is only half the eccentricity of an object - for example, an object placed six degrees of visual angle from where the point the eyes are looking at would be interfered with only by other objects closer to it than three degrees of visual angle [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970a]. This is a far cry from the nearly 90 degrees of an entire hemifield, or even of a quadrant. The more viable theory, then, is those that align more with the concept of a neural resource that spans the hemifield.

A number of studies have found that the activity of some parietal and frontal areas of cortex increase steadily with the number of targets in MOT [@culhamAttentionResponseFunctions2001; @howeUsingFMRIDistinguish2009; @jovicichBrainAreasSpecific2001; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014; @nummenmaaCorticalCircuitBinding2017], consistent with the importance of a pool of attentional resources. These studies did not focus, however, on the extent to which these activations are specific to the hemifield-specific nature of target load. The only imaging study I am aware of that investigated the issue is @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 who found an activation difference when the objects designated as targets were in opposite hemifields compared to when they were in the same hemifield. This was found for the superior parietal lobule and transverse parieto-occipital area, but not the anterior intraparietal sulcus. 
<!--"In behavioral performance, participants tracked with higher accuracy when the 2 target pinwheels fell in opposite hemifields than in the same hemifield. A corresponding difference in brain activity was observed in the SPL (P < 0.05) and TrPO (P < 0.005), where activity was higher for track-2 unilateral than track-2 bilateral. The visual field arrangement did not affect activity in aIPS, however (P > 0.10), revealing a possible further dissociation in the PPC between the anterior and posterior" -->

The neural correlates of the hemifield-specific resource was investigated by @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 using EEG. They found that the SSVEP activation for targets was higher than that for distractors when the two targets, especially when the two targets were positioned in different (left and right) hemifields. In contrast, an ERP component known as the P3 thought to reflect more cognitive identification and decision processes was similar in the two conditions. This is consistent with the theory that tracking depends on both hemisphere-specific attentive processing followed by some involvement of higher-order processes that are not hemisphere-specific.

@battelliRoleParietalLobe2009 found they could disrupt MOT performance in a hemifield by stimulating the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Importantly, however, this only occurred when the moving targets were present in both hemifields. When the targets were all in the left or all in the right hemifield, TMS to the left or to the right IPS had no effect on tracking accuracy, and this was replicated in a second experiment. These findings bring to mind the competition between the two hemifields that is evident in the "extinction" symptom observed in parietal neglect patients. In extinction, responding to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to parietal injury only shows significant impairment if there are also stimuli presented to the ipsilateral hemifield. This inspired Battelli to explain their findings with two propositions. The first is that the IPS in each hemisphere can mediate the tracking of targets in *either* visual hemifield. The second is that under normal conditions, inhibitory processes reduce the amount of ipsilateral processing by each IPS, causing tracking capacity to effectively be hemifield-specific in many circumstances.

The complex relationship of the hemispheres is further illustrated by evidence from patients. @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 found that in patients with damage to their right parietal lobe, MOT performance only in the left visual field was impaired relative to control participants. Evidently the right parietal lobe does not normally mediate tracking in the right visual field, so losing it did not hurt right visual field tracking performance. But for another task, these right parietal patients had substantial impairments in *both* hemifields. Impairment on that task, an apparent motion task, is believed to be a result of a deficit for registering the relative timing of visual events. The involvement of the right parietal lobe, but not the left parietal lobe, in judging the temporal order of stimuli in both hemifields was further supported in an additional study with both patients and with TMS [@agostaPivotalRoleRight2017].

In summary, while there is evidence that each parietal lobe is involved in field-wide processing for some tasks, it also likely mediates the hemifield independence evident in some circumstances. Using ERP, @drewSoftHandoffAttention2014 fund evidence that when a target crosses the vertical midline, say from the left to the right hemifield, the left hemisphere becomes involved shortly before the target reaches the right hemifield, and the right hemisphere remains involved for a short time after the crossing. Because this was modulated by predictability of the motion, it did not appear to be wholly mediated by the well-known overlap of the two hemispheres' receptive fields at the midline. This phenomenon may reflect the normally-inhibited ipsilateral representation of the visual field by parietal cortices highlighted by @battelliRoleParietalLobe2009, although the location the ERP signals originated from was not clear so this remains uncertain.

Both @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 and @minamiHemifieldCrossingsMultiple2019 found evidence for a tracking performance cost when a target in MOT crossed the vertical midline. Evidently the handoff of control from one hemisphere to another is not completely efficient. @saikiRobustColorshapeBinding2019 also found wome evidence in a memory paradigm that when two objects moved between hemifields, memory for their features was more disrupted than when they moved fron one to another quadrant within the same hemifield. @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 also found no cost when targets moved between quadrants while remaining within a hemifield, an important finding given that other work raised the prospect of quadrant-specific resources [@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007]. 

In summary, areas of the parietal cortex may subserve both the hemifield-specific tracking resource that dominates most MOT tasks and the more limited resource that is not specific to a hemifield. More work must be done however to determine the role of frontal lobe regions. Such regions could potentially play a role in the hemifield-specific resource, the hemifield-independent resource, or both.

## What else are hemifield-specific resources used for?

Multiple object tracking is closely associated with spatial selection, which is an important process for many other visual tasks. Given the hemifield specificity of spatial attentional selection suggested by MOT, then, one might expect to find strong hemifield-specificity of other visual cognition tasks in addition to MOT. 

Many researchers have examined tasks involving two simultaneously-presented stimuli and compared performance when the two stimuli are presented in the same hemifield to performance when they are presented in different hemifields. For example, @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971 found that the reporting of two briefly-presented digits is more accurate when the digits are presented in different hemifields than in the same hemifield. However, this study and many others did not include a single-stimulus condition, so when performance is higher in the split condition, we don't know how close that is to the one-target level of performance and thus the degree of hemifield-specificity cannot be quantified. Other studies use response time as a measure, which is also difficult to interpret [@awhEvidenceSplitAttentional2000; @serenoDiscriminationHemifieldsNew1991; @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971]. 

<!-- A' is no good https://sites.google.com/a/mtu.edu/whynotaprime/ -->
@delvenneCapacityVisualShortterm2005 used both dual-target and single-target conditions in a visual working memory task. For spatial working memory, he estimated 40% hemifield independence, although unfortunately he used the discredited A' measure of performance [@zhangNoteROCAnalysis2005] and did not space the stimuli widely enough to reduce the possibility of spatial interference. Nevertheless, the advantage appears to be large and did not occur for color working memory [@delvenneVisualShorttermMemory2012]. More generally, only tasks with spatial demands seem to show much hemifield specificity [@holtBilateralAdvantageMaintaining2015; @umemotoBilateralAdvantageStorage2010]

@alvarezAnatomicalConstraintsAttention2012a studied visual search, with the items to search through arrayed bilaterally or unilaterally. In standard visual search, they found only a small advantage of the vertical meridian split. However, in a subset search task where participants knew the target would be located in one of several locations designated by a pre-trial cue, they found a large bilateral advantage. However, when the relevant locations were prominently indicated by a color difference, this advantage largely disappeared. These results, and those in the rest of the literature, suggest that hemifield advantages are strongest when spatial selection is critical.

@strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 investigated working memory for stimuli that moved either within a hemifield or between hemifields. For between-hemifield movement, they found a substantial decrease in accuracy for the spatial task of remembering which positions of a 2x2 grid contained dots at the beginning of the trial, before the (empty) grid moved - 79% correct for between-hemifield movement, and 85% correct for within-hemifield movement. No such cost was found for color or identity memory tasks. This between-hemifield cost for spatial memory was similar to the cost they found for MOT itself.

This association between spatial tasks and hemifield specificity may reflect a large-scale difference in how the brain processes spatial versus identity information. Famously, the dorsal stream that leads to the parietal cortices are more concerned with spatial information than is the ventral stream that is more involved in object recognition [@goodaleSeparateVisualPathways1992]. Neural responses in the dorsal pathway to parietal cortex are largely contralateral [@serenoMappingContralateralSpace2001], although as we have seen . This is also true of other brain areas thought to contribute to a "saliency map" [@fecteauSalienceRelevanceFiring2006], such as the frontal eye fields [@haglerjrSpatialMapsFrontal2006], the superior colliculus [@schneiderVisualResponsesHuman2005], and the pulvinar [@cottonContralateralVisualHemifield2007a]. In contrast, identity-related processing seems to involve more bilateral neural responses and connectivity between hemispheres [@cohenUsingNeuronalPopulations2011; @hemondPreferenceContralateralStimuli2007].

Multiple identity tracking, which is discussed further in section \@ref(identity), combines the location-updating aspect of multiple object tracking with an additional requirement: maintaining knowledge of what features belong to each of the objects. Across four experiments, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 consistently found partial hemifield independence, ranging from 26 to 37% (my calculation of this is [here](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)) with a paradigm that yielded `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence for MOT. This is consistent with the suggestion of the findings listed above that a spatial selection and/or location updating processes are much more hemisphere-specific than processes that require maintenance of non-spatial features.

## Hemispheric differences

Neural differences between the left and right hemispheres can be attenuated at the behavioral level by the cross-hemisphere integration that typically occurs prior to a behavioral response. The functional independence of the two hemispheres for multiple object tracking, then, provides a greater potential to show hemifield differences in performance. As it turns out, differences are observed, but these differences do not seem to be large.

In four experiments conducted by @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014, we reported either a trend for or statistically significant advantage for targets in the right hemifield (Figure A2). <!--Interestingly, there was some non-significant evidence that this was greater in their one-target condition than in their two-target condition.    Figure 4 of @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 like Holcombe et al. (2014) finds (non-significant) better tracking performance in RVF than the left only when tracking one rather than more than one--> A right hemifield advantage might potentially be explained by the theory that stimuli presented to the right hemifield are processed by both hemispheres to a greater degree than are stimuli presented to the left hemifield, which is also thought to explain why left neglect is more common than right neglect. Specifically, it is thought that the right hemisphere mediates attention to *both* hemifields [@mesulamSpatialAttentionNeglect1999], such that the right hemifield is doubly represented. However, while @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 confirmed a right hemifield advantage in their MOT experiments, they instead find a left visual field advantage for spatial working memory experiments, even though spatial working memory is also though to be mediated by parietal cortex. Most strikingly, @matthewsLeftVisualField2015 found a large advantage for temporal order judgments and simultaneity judgments for stimuli presented to the left hemifield. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that the left hemifield advantage for timing tasks reflects a specialization for timing in the right parietal cortex [@battelliBilateralDeficitsTransient2003], even though human specialization for language, which is thought to be in part an enhancement of timing and sequencing abilities, has occurred more in the left hemisphere.

The situation becomes even more complex once one considers that there subtle interactions between the two hemispheres seem to affect attention in each hemifield, as highlighted in the "the underlying mechanisms" section above. One illustration of this is a recent finding by @edwardsBehavioralGainFollowing2021. They had participants perform MOT in either hemifield for a 30 min session, and afterwards found that performance in the *untrained* hemifield improved significantly. The reason for this is not clear, but could reflect "fatigue" by the hemisphere contralateral to the trained hemifield causing it to reduce its inhibition of the other hemisphere. Alternatively, the mechanism could be potentiation of the untrained hemisphere as a result of the deprivation, which may be the reason why depriving one *eye* results in increased cortical activity when that eye is stimulated later [@lunghiBriefPeriodsMonocular2011].

# A serial sampler? {#serialOrParallel}

Brains have a massively parallel architecture. Yet as we have seen, tracking performance drops steeply with target load, indicating that tracking is highly capacity-limited. Note that even with limited capacity, targets might still be processed in parallel. A limited-capacity process could be spread thinly across the targets for simultaneous parallel processing. Alternatively, it might instead be allocated in serial to a small subset of the targets (or even just one) in turn.

<!--Of the processes that underlie tracking, even those with the smallest capacity might still process the objects in small sets, but sets of greater than one.
 
One can certainly walk and chew gum at the same time, and even simultaneously use one hand to rub one's belly and the other to tap one's head, although it may take a bit of practice for some of us. However, when it comes to making a keypress based on the identity of a visual stimulus with one hand and based on the identity of a sound with the other hand, the evidence suggests that one particular component of these two tasks simply cannot be done simultaneously @pashlerDualtaskInterferenceSimple1994. Specifically, the pattern of response times indicates that while a choice is being made in response to the visual stimulus, choice processing for the auditory stimulus cannot commence.-->

Whether the processes that underlie MOT involve a serial component has been one of the chief concerns of researchers since the very first paper on the topic by @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988. Whether limited-capacity attentional processes are serial or parallel has been a top concern of the field more generally as well. Serial processing could occur one-by-one or a few at a time. Many researchers have been influence by Treisman's theory that certain forms of feature binding and other judgments require a serial one-by-one process, but this has not been established definitively. A reason for the uncertainty is that limited-capacity and serial architectures can yield identical behavioral data in common paradigms.

As we will see, tracking provides evidence for serial processing from a new angle.

<!--A major ambition is to create a unified theory that explains properties of both tracking and other tasks such as visual search and dual-task performance.-->

<!--A serial account of tracking is that a process must switch from target to target to update targets' positions, one-by-one.--> 

## The case for serial position sampling

After a few assumptions are made, serial sampling makes a specific prediction for the temporal limits on tracking. The most basic assumption is that after a moving target's position is sampled, if its position is not re-sampled before another object takes its place, it will be lost. This is a consequence of the visual system assuming that the objects nearest to the last-recorded positions of the targets are, in fact, the targets. Related to this assumption is that the system does not use motion direction and speed reliably. The evidence that speaks to this is discussed in section \@ref(beyondLocation), but even if it is false, note that violations of this assumption would simply reduce the the size of the effects predicted by the serial account. 
 
For circular trajectories such as those used by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013, the product of the speed (in revolutions per second) and number of objects determines how often sampling must be done to avoid losing a target. In an MOT trial with two targets, after one target is sampled, a one-by-one serial process would switch to the other target. If the distractor trailing the target arrives near the first target's former location before the serial process switches back, then we can expect tracking to fail.

Increases in the number of targets reduces how often each individual target is sampled. As a result, the serial switching account predicts a linear relationship between the number of targets and the temporal limit on tracking. In Figure \@ref(fig:serialModelFit) below, the predictions are plotted if tracking samples position and switches to another object every 60 ms and every 90 ms.

<!--
If one object is sampled every 100 ms, then if it is replaced every 200ms, you have 100% ambiguity in the correspondence problem. So to get sampling time from temporal limit, divide by 2. HolcombeChen & RoudaiaFaubert observed about 140 ms for young men, meaning 70 ms.

With every unit increase in the number of targets, the interval between successive samples of that target increases by the sampling time. This is under an optimistic assumption of orderly sampling (the sampling process sampling first one target, then the second target, then the third target, and back to the first target, rather than sampling the second target or third target again); otherwise the predicted slope should be even steeper.

Because a particular sampling time specifies the temporal limits for all target sizes, no parameters needed to be fit here. That is, the dashed lines in Figure \@ref(fig:serialModelFit) are not best-fitting regression lines. Their slope and intercept are determined by the sampling time indicated. The lines fit the data fairly well. But how impressed should we be by this? One limitation is that only three target loads were tested, so we should have little confidence that the relationship is truly linear in the way that the model predicts.

An additional issue for interpreting the relationship is that in principle, the temporal limit for covertly tracking a *single* target could be set by a different process than the serial switching hypothesized to set the limit for two and three targets, because with a single target, there is no need to switch attention around. Suprisingly, however, evidence from other paradigms suggests that even when only a single static location is relevant for attention, performance oscillates over time, a pattern which has been dubbed the "blinking spotlight of attention" [@vanrullenBlinkingSpotlightAttention2007; @fiebelkornReportRhythmicSampling2013].

Thus, we should not really expect the temporal limit for one target to fall on the same line as that for two and for three targets. Yet in the plotted data (Figure \@ref(fig:serialModelFit)), it can be seen that the one-target limit may actually fall on the same line. It's as if the sampling interval of attention for a single static location also sets the inter-object sampling interval. While the data are consistent with this, they support this proposition only weakly, because there is considerable statistical uncertainty associated with the data points.

The means for the male and predominantly-male datasets, which are the lower clusters, imply temporal limits, when tracking one target, between `r ms<- round( (temporalLimsData %>% filter(targets==1))$temporalLimit ,-1); ms[1]` and `r ms[3]` ms. Recall that because the target must be sampled at twice the temporal limit to avoid confusion with the trailing distractor, one could infer sampling rates from this between `r round(ms[1]/2)` and `r round(ms[3]/2)` ms. This assumes near-perfect linking of a target's last-sampled position with the nearest neighbor in the new sample. The example dashed lines represent the predictions if sampling occurred at 60 ms (red) and 90 ms (blue) and switching occurred systematically rather than visiting one target twice before sampling the third.

How do these numbers compare to sampling intervals inferred with other paradigms? @macdonaldAttentionalSamplingMultiple2013 studied the continuous wagon-wheel illusion, in which a rotating spoked circle is sometimes perceived to rotate backwards, for which a leading explanation is intermittent sampling []. Asking participants to report reversals when they viewed multiple spoked circles, they inferred a sampling interval of `r round(1000/13.3)` ms<!--13.3 Hz-->, which assumes, among other things, that perceived reverse motion is strongest when the wheel travels three-quarters of the inter-spoke angle between samples, yielding a one-quarter backwards rotation with each sample. Their `r round(1000/13.3)` ms figure is similar to what we inferred from tracking. However, @arnoldIllusoryMotionReversals2014 found that the peak frequency for perception of illusory backwards rotation differed for equiluminant motion (5 Hz) and luminance-defined motion (10 Hz in their test), suggesting that results from such experiments cannot be interpreted as providing a constant simple sampling rate for high-level vision. <!--also for moving objects, although the rate is harder to interpret. MacDonald & Vanrullen assume motion signal is strongest at 1/4 of cycle, but I seem to remember that was argued by Nakayama but can't remember it's sure -->

Studies that use other behavioral paradigms in an attempt to investigate visual sampling suggest sampling intervals longer than 100 ms: `r round(1000/7,-1)` ms [@reFeatureBasedAttentionSamples2019]<!--They claimed 8 Hz in their paper but the figure shows the peak at 7 Hz-->, 142 ms [@vanrullenBlinkingSpotlightAttention2007], `r round(1000/7.5,-1)` ms <!--claimed 8 Hz but had equal power at 7 and 8-->[@fiebelkornReportRhythmicSampling2013], and `r round(1000/7.14,-1)` ms [@dugueAttentionSearchesNonuniformly2015]<!--said ~7 Hz but sampling was very coarse, one peak at 7.14--><!--For the @reFeatureBasedAttentionSamples2019 paper, they wrote in their conclusion that sampling occurred at 8 Hz, but their figure shows a peak at 7 Hz, so I have used 7 Hz or `r round(1000/7,-1)` ms.-->, although the statistics used in some of these studies may have led to spurious findings [@brookshireReevaluatingRhythmicAttentional2021]. A visual search study that recorded from neurons in monkeys suggested a 44 ms sampling interval [@buschmanSerialCovertShifts2009]. These other studies all used stationary objects or multiple locations that the participant was told to monitor, which conceivably could explain the slower sampling intervals found in some, but there also remains ample reason otherwise for uncertainty.

Despite the sizable and growing neurophysiological and neuroimaging literature on oscillations and intermittent sampling, I have not found a study that tests whether the sampling operates independently in the two hemifields. This is unfortunate because a hallmark of tracking is its hemifield independence, as reviewed in \@ref(twoBrains). <!--Is the spotlight oscillation hemisphere-specific? Finding of 7 Hz for feature attention by @reFeatureBasedAttentionSamples2019 suggests global.)-->

It might turn out that even after researchers regularly assess whether the sampling they are measuring is hemifield-independent, there will continue to be a large range of rates found. If so, perhaps different tasks result in different sampling rates, and the sampling process can occur more quickly for tracking as it requires sampling position only. Another possibility is that the assumptions underlying the calculations in behavioral studies such as object tracking are wrong. If, for example, motion direction is used to guide the next position sampled, tracking could succeed with a slower sampling interval more similar to those documented in most of the neural studies cited above (but see section \@ref(beyondLocation)).

A few studies, while finding evidence for oscillations in some conditions, do not find it to be tied to cued locations in the same way as other papers cited above suggest [@werfNoEvidenceRhythmic2021; @petersObjectbasedAttentionPrioritizes2020]. The fact that psychology and neuroscience researchers admit to substantial rates of publication bias and p-hacking [@jenningsPublicationBiasNeuroimaging2012; @johnMeasuringPrevalenceQuestionable2012; @rabeloQuestionableResearchPractices2020] raises the spectre of further, unpublished, evidence that is inconsistent with the prevailing narrative of regular oscillations that correspond to an attentional sampling rate.

In summary, despite a wealth of neuroscientific evidence that serial sampling occurs for attentional tasks, which might account nicely for the existence of a coarse temporal limit on tracking, and for its dramatic worsening with target load, more evidence would be needed for this to be strongly supported. And serial sampling is not the only possible explanation of the steep decrease of temporal limit with target load. Conceivably, a parallel process of evidence accumulation with limited capacity could fit the data. Under this account, when attention is split among multiple targets, this greatly slows the rate that of accumulation of evidence for some process that is critical to tracking. This process could be linking successive position samples, if samples do not occur less often with more targets because the visual system takes global snapshots; however, the evidence from other paradigms rules against global snapshots [e.g. @klineIllusoryMotionReversal2004]. For a parallel theory without intermittent sampling, the matching process wouldn't be operating no discrete positions, but rather the spatiotemporal blur streaks described in the next section.

## Evidence for parallel processing

@howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 applied the simultaneous-sequential presentation technique developed by @shiffrinVisualProcessingCapacity1972 to investigate the nature of parallel or serial processing involved in MOT. The technique was developed for tasks involving stationary stimuli and was originally conceived as investigating whether several stimuli could be processed in parallel without being affected by any capacity limit. The stimuli are presented either all at once (simultaneously) or in succession (sequentially) during a trial, half the stimuli presented in the first interval, and the other half in the second interval. To equate the total amount of time each stimulus is presented in the simultaneous and successive conditions, a trial in the simultaneous condition is only half as long as that of the successive condition. The technique has been applied extensively to the detection of a particular alphanumeric character among other alphanumeric characters, and researchers have found that processing in the simultaneous condition is equal to or better than the sequential condition [@shiffrinVisualProcessingCapacity1972; @hungSimultaneousBetterSequential1995], suggesting that multiple alphanumeric characters can be recognized in parallel, with no capacity limitation, or at least a capacity that is not taxed by up to the four stimuli typically used. An alternative possibility is that attention for some reason did not select the locations of the presented stimuli during the two intervals of the sequential condition. For example, if attention got "stuck" on the locations of the first half of stimuli, it would fail to show the advantage expected for a limited-capacity process that could devote all its resources to each of the two subsets of the stimuli during their respective presentation intervals.

@howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 adapted this technique to MOT by, in a "sequential" condition, periodically pausing half of the moving targets, and in the simultaneous condition pausing all of the targets periodically. Comparing tracking accuracy in the simultaneous condition to the sequential condition in eight experiments, they found that performance was equal or better in the simultaneous condition than in the sequential condition. They interpreted this result as ruling against a serial model whereby tracking is accomplished by switching a process important for tracking from one (or a few) targets to the others. One assumption of this interpretation is that a serial process should be able to efficiently switch away from targets when they are stationary to selectively process the moving targets. As @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 pointed out, there is good evidence from other MOT experiments that participants can prioritize the most important targets or those perceived to be more difficult to track, for example in virtue of them moving faster [@chenResourceDemandsObject2013; @croweGoaldirectedUnequalAttention2019]. A concern with the @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 experiments, however, is that the longest non-movement interval used in the experiments was half a second, and in most of the experiments, the interval was only a few hundred milliseconds. It is possible that at that rate, a serial process was unable or ineffective at switching from the stationary targets to the moving targets and back again. In addition, the locations of the stationary targets had to be remembered (to distinguish them from the stationary distractors) so that the serial tracking process could switch back to them. This is quite different from the demands of studies such as that of @shiffrinVisualProcessingCapacity1972, where the task was just to detect a single target from among the (stationary) candidate locations. @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 did conduct one experiment which used a 1.5 s interval for the movement and non-movement phases, but they designed this study deliberately to favor serial processing by presenting only two targets and strictly alternating which of them was moving and which was stationary. As a result, in contrast to all of their other experiments they found an advantage for the sequential condition, and they concluded that the 1.5 s interval "was more than sufficient for observers to transfer their attention from one target to another". But this again raises the question of whether the intervals in the other experiments were simply too short for the serial process to reallocate appropriately. It may be that as one increases the pause interval toward 1.5 s, at some point the sequential condition will show an advantage over the simultaneous condition. What is the criterion for saying what interval is so long that a sequential advantage there no longer speaks to tracking processes? In a study of word recognition, @scharffExtendingSimultaneoussequentialParadigm2011 used the sequential versus simultaneous technique to investigate contrast discrimination and visual word recognition. They found no advantage of the sequential condition for judging which of an array of low-contrast discs had a higher contrast, which they interpreted as consistent with parallel, unlimited-capacity processing. In the word recognition task, in contrast, they found a large sequential advantage, which they took as evidence of serial processing. The interval they used was 1.1 seconds, again raising the possibility that @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 might have found a different result with longer intervals. In sum, while the @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 evidence might have provided evidence for serial processing and yet did not, a strong possibility remains that in conventional MOT tasks, a serial process rapidly switches among the targets.


In their eight experiments, unfortunately @howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010 used approximately the same short interval, 

This finding supports a parallel model of processing wherein all the locations are processed even during the intervals when half of the targets are stationary.

An assumption is that any parallel processes are distributed equally among both moving and any temporarily-stationary target, whereas a serial process is reallocated away from the stationary targets during the interval that they are stationary. Such a serial process would then result in higher performance in the condition where targets occasionally pause relative to an "all pause" condition where all targets are temporarily-stationary at the same time.

## Objects moving every which way

In the behavioral studies that revealed the temporal limits on tracking, a target and its distractors all shared the same circular trajectory. But in most studies of MOT, the distractors near a target are often moving at many different angles, or even in the opposite direction, to the target.

Accounting for tracking entirely with serial sampling process has not been successful with such trajectories [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992]. As a result, models of MOT today rely largely on parallel updating of target positions (a serial process is used in some models for other features, which is discussed in \@ref(identity)) [@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016; @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019; @liModelMultipleIdentity2019; @oksamaDynamicBindingIdentity2008a; @srivastavaAttentionDynamicsMultiple2015]. These parallel theories do not seem able to account for the basic temporal limit discovered with circular trajectories and showcased in \@ref(speedAndTime), nor for the temporal limit's dramatic decrease with target load. 

Given that these models can't account for the temporal limits on tracking, why have they been fairly successful in mimicking human performance with the typical MOT displays not designed to probe the temporal limit? Well, for typical MOT displays, it remains unclear how much temporal interference we should expect - no one has bothered to calculate the distribution of the intervals between targets and distractors visiting a given location. Second, it is not clear how identifiable the models are from the human data. That is, a number of different models, with a large range of possible parameters, might equally explain the data. One reason is that potential spatial interference and for temporal interference are confounded in typical MOT displays. That is, trials in which the moving objects come close to each other in space also tend to be trials in which moving objects visit approximately the same location in a short span of time. As a result, a model that embodies spatial interference only may explain the data about as well as one that includes temporal interference. 

Two strategies to improve the constraints on models present themselves. One is to fix the individual components of the models based on the results of experiments designed to isolate those component, such as the experiments by [@verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017] for identifying temporal limits and that of @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 to identify the range of spatial crowding. Another strategy is to model much larger sets of data, at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from at most two different MOT experiments.

The circular trajectories that were used to reveal the temporal limits on tracking and the less-constrained trajectories of typical MOT experiments differ in one way that we have not yet discussed. This arises from the fact that the objects in typical MOT experiments do not share their trajectory with other objects. Srimant Tripathy and his collaborators have suggested that a moving object leaves an extended trace that lingers in sensory memory and that tracking processes operate on that representation rather than objects' instantaneous positions  [@tripathyMultipleObjectTrackingSerial2011; @howardMultipleTrajectoryTracking2012]. If so, targets and distractors can be disambiguated as a result of their differing motion directions (which manifests as different orientations of the sensory memories) in addition to their positions. This could mean that temporal interference is less of a factor in typical MOT displays. However, the evidence is that motion direction information is not used much when there are more than two targets, as reviewed in the next section ( \@ref(beyondLocation)), which casts some doubt on Tripathy's suggestion.

# Mobile computation 

We live in a world of constantly moving objects. The receptive fields in our early visual cortices that analyze the properties of objects are largely stationary. In the case of moving objects, these individual analyzers get only a glimpse of moving objects before they move on. These glimpses will sometimes be too brief to fully process the object. What makes things even worse is that in our world of moving objects, another object may quickly move onto the retinal location previously occupied by the old object, such that extended analysis by our stationary receptive fields may combine the two objects, yielding a mish-mash of features.

This phenomenon is demonstrated by the below movie (if it doesn't play, you should be able to view it [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/g4FWsHsyYwnphuEyh5/source.gif)). Keep your gaze fixed on the circle in the center, and try to judge for one of the flip-flopping objects whether the light green color is paired with leftward tilt or rightward tilt.
You may find this difficult or impossible to judge. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Task: fixate the circle and judge whether the red color is paired with leftward tilt or rightward tilt."}

if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("movies/OC4HzNoGuide.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/OC4HzNoGuide_static.gif")
#, height = "250px"
```

Rarely in the real world do objects rapidly alternate as they do in the above movie. Instead, the reason that individual receptive fields sometimes get brief glimpses is because objects are rapidly moving rather than alternating. The brain capitalizes on this by accumulating the results of visual analysis from the successive locations that a moving object visits [@nishidaMotionbasedAnalysisSpatial2004a; @nishidaHumanVisualSystem2007a].

You may be able to experience this "mobile computation" in action by viewing the below movie (if it doesn't play below, you should be able to view it [here](movies/OC4HzGuide_static.gif)). This time, while keeping your gaze fixed on the circle in the center, try to track the white circle with your attention as it steps about the circle. This may allow you to judge whether the light green is paired with leftward or rightward tilt [@cavanaghMobileComputationSpatiotemporal2008].

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Task: fixate the circle and judge whether the light green is paired with leftward tilt or rightward title."}

#, height = "250px"
``` 

This second movie is identical to the first except for the addition of the stepping white ring. Tracking the ring with attention feels almost automatic thanks to it being the only moving object. The continuous selection enabled by tracking here evidently provides later stages of visual processing with an extended view of the object, allowing it to deliver the feature pairing [@cavanaghMobileComputationSpatiotemporal2008]. This interpretation is consistent with ideas about feature pairing introduced by Treisman. The "spotlight" of selection gates later processing by later stages, which is what is required for feature pairing.

As we saw in a previous section (\@ref{bottlenecks}), tracking is capacity-limited; in many circumstances one can only track a few objects. Here we highlighted that tracking, like other instances of attentional selection, serves to gate what information is used by subsequent processing. So, what do we know about the limits of subsequent processing, and how those interact with attentional tracking?

## Attentional tracking and mobile computation

@holcombePerceivingSpatialRelations2011 investigated the relationship of attentional tracking to various judgments that can be made about two arrays of concentric colored circles. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap=""}
#Work-around to make GIFs (but not .mov) work by avoiding including them in non-html outputs!
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64038037/can-i-conditionally-exclude-some-elements-code-blocks-from-rendering-to-the-pd
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("movies/LinaresVaziriPashkamHolcombe/pairingOneStimulusCycleSoRotatesPerenially.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/LinaresVaziriPashkamHolcombe/pairingOneStimulusCycleSoRotatesPereniallyStatic.gif")
#, height = "250px"
```

With these arrays, participants can be asked to judge the individual colors that are present and also their spatial arrangement. At the speed of rotation seen above, it is quite easy for many to covertly track a disc while fixating their eyes on the array's center. At high speeds over 1.4 revolutions per second or so, however, @holcombePerceivingSpatialRelations2011 found that their participants could only guess at which object was originally cued at the beginning of the trial (tracking speed limits are discussed further in section BLAH). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap=""}
#Work-around to make GIFs (but not .mov) work by avoiding including them in non-html outputs!

#, height = "250px"
```

Above their tracking limit (a bit faster for most than the movie above), participants were still able to judge which colors were present in the display, indicating that tracking was not needed for that. <!--This was revealed by using different colors for the array on different trials and asking participants to report which colors were present.--> Participants were unable, however, to judge the spatial arrangement of the colors.

In one of the spatial arrangement tasks, the participants were asked to report any three colors in sequence from around a ring, in the direction of motion. For the display above, then, for the inner ring correct answers included "blue, yellow, purple" or "yellow, purple, blue", but not "yellow, blue, purple" (the participants made their response by clicking on colors with a mouse, so they did not need to know color names). In a second spatial arrangement task, participants were tasked with reporting any two colors that were aligned with each other between the two rings. The correct answers for the above display, then, were "green and yellow", "red and purple", and "blue and aqua".

For those two spatial arrangement tasks, the speed limit, as quantified by 75% threshold, was similar to (and statistically indistinguishable from) the tracking limit. This suggests that tracking is required to apprehend the spatial arrangement. Identifying the colors, in contrast, could be done at much faster speeds, suggesting that tracking was not necessary for it.

A need for focused attention to apprehend spatial arrangements had already been strongly suggested by evidence from visual search and dual task paradigms [@liRapidNaturalScene2002; @leeAttentionalCapacityUndifferentiated1999a; @loganSpatialAttentionApprehension1994; @wolfeWhatCan0001998]. Dual task paradigms had also already found that the colors presented could be identified even in the presence of very demanding secondary tasks that greatly reduce the amount of attention available [@leeAttentionalCapacityUndifferentiated1999a; @braunWithdrawingAttentionLittle1998a]. Here, then, our tracking experiments converged with those results, indicating that the same kind of attentional resource whose allocation to a target is reduced by increasing the set size in visual search and by a demanding secondary task is also eliminated by moving objects faster than they can be tracked.

Not all spatial relationships, however, require an ample amount of focused attention. In the @holcombePerceivingSpatialRelations2011 study, one particular spatial relationship, alignment of the inner and outer rings, could be judged even at object speeds far above the tracking speed limit. For that alignment task, the two concentric rings comprised the same colors in the same sequence. On some trials, these colors were aligned, so that neighboring colors in the radial direction were identical. Participants had to discriminate between that and when neighboring colors in the radial direction were different. While the participants' mean tracking speed threshold was 1.4 rps, their speed threshold for the alignment task was 2.4 rps. The processes that mediate the alignment judgment are not clear, but likely are those pre-attentive mechanisms that integrate information over space and time regarding spatial differences, for example to extract texture boundaries and global shape [@motoyoshiTemporalResolutionOrientationbased2001; @ramachandranPhantomContoursNew1991a].

Such boundary and global shape processing seem to integrate across multiple features, but do not pass on information about the constituent features (here, colors) whose arrangement created the boundary or shape [@wilsonDetectionGlobalStructure1998; @cliffordRapidGlobalForm2004]. It seems that only focused attention can do that. But how does focused attention do it? One idea that probably goes way back is that to apprehend a spatial relationship, attention must identify the colors in the colors' locations one by one e.g., @huangCharacterizingLimitsHuman2007].

A particular pattern of errors made by participants in the experiments of @holcombePerceivingSpatialRelations2011 supports the serial processing theory. Recall the spatial arrangement task in which participants were required to report two of the colors aligned with each other in the inner and outer rings. In a variation of that task, each trial began with a central color cue. That color could be in either the inner ring or the outer ring. Participants were told to report which color in the other ring was aligned with that color. The speed of the rings were set to slightly below the tracking speed limit. Thanks to feature-based attention, finding the cued color was not difficult [@shihThereFeaturebasedAttentional1996]. Often the participants reported correctly the color that was aligned with the cued color. On those trials where participants made an error, they typically reported a color that was adjacent to the correct one, located either leading it (relative to the directon of motion) or trailing it. Critically, trailing errors were much more likely than leading errors. The best explanation of this, after a few control conditions were examined, appears to be that participants made a shift of attention from the cued ring to the other ring, but because the ring kept moving during that shift, they sometimes missed and landed on the trailing disc, resulting in a mistaken report of its color.

Using a completely different approach based on EEG and eye movements, @franconeriFlexibleVisualProcessing2011 also concluded that spatial relationships are calculated by identifying the constituent objects one-by-one. In summary, when objects move, attentional tracking is necessary to set up the focused attentional shifts that are needed to extract most spatial relationships.

# Knowing where but not what {#identity}

Consider what someone means when they say they are keeping track of something, for example their family. That likely would mean knowing where each of their siblings is, where their mother is, and where their father is. But the multiple object tracking task does not test peoples' knowledge of the different identities of targets. Rather, the targets are typically all identical to each other (and to the distractors) and people need only report where the targets are.

This section is about what you know about the objects you are tracking. The answer is: surprisingly little. We can break the question down into two parts. The first part is the extent to which the processes that mediate tracking use the targets' features to keep track of them, and the second is how much we are able to report about the targets' features.

Computer algorithms have been developed for object tracking to facilitate detection of intrusions and safety threats in industrial settings. They are also used for analyzing the movements of players of an opposing team's previous games as well as the movements of animals in lab experiments. When developing tracking algorithms, engineers do not confine themselves to using only the locations and motions of objects - they also use the appearance of those objects, for example their shapes and colors. This helps the algorithm match objects across video frames (the correspondence problem, sometimes known as the "data association problem" in engineering)  [@yilmazObjectTrackingSurvey2006a]. This allows successful tracking in situations where location and motion alone would result in losing a target.  

Whether the human visual system uses feature similarity to facilitate motion correspondence is an empirical question. Beginning more than a century ago, Gestalt psychologists such as Max Wertheimer found that apparent motion was equally strong whether the objects in successive frames were identical or different [@wertheimerExperimentelleStudienUber1912]. Later studies found some effect of similarity, but it was weak [@kolersFiguralChangeApparent1971; @burtTimeDistanceFeature1981]. However, when the successive presented frames of an object touch or overlap with each other rather than being presented in non-contiguous locations, the results can be different. The study of such displays, with a different object appearance (usually, shape) in two successive frames, is known as line motion or transformational apparent motion. These studies have found that feature similarity, especially contour continuity, but also color, can decide which tokens are matched [@faubertInfluenceTwoSpatially1995; @tseRoleParsingHighlevel1998]. Thus, feature similarity is involved in motion processing, even though in many situations motion correspondence is determined by spatiotemporal luminance relationships. An important characteristic of this process that does does not seem to have been studied, however, is whether these cues are processed in parallel. Short-range spatiotemporal luminance relationships ("motion energy") are known to be processed by local detectors, such that visual search happens in parallel for a target moving in an odd direction defined by small-displacement apparent motion [@horowitzAttentionApparentMotion1994]. I am not aware of any studies that have investigated this for transformational apparent motion, in a situation where the perceived motion direction is determined by feature similarity. Thus, the possibility remains that feature similarity has its influence through what I have called a C~1 process.

Whether features are used by processes involved in motion correspondence is a different question than whether they are available to conscious awareness. We are of course aware of object features when the only task we are engaged in is tracking a single target. In that situation, our limited-capacity processes can all be applied to that target. However, when we are tracking multiple targets, the evidence indicates that we have little ability to report the objects' features, other than their locations.

A common view of perception is that lack of awareness of the features of objects one is attending to could not happen. Indeed, many people seem to believe that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in the central portion of our visual field, so unless an object actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everything in the scene is at all times, and we should immediately detect any changes to these objects. For many, change blindness demonstrations are the first experience that disrupts this belief.

Experiments suggest that during change blindness, although people cannot monitor a large number of objects at once, they are able to monitor several, perhaps four or five [@rensinkVisualSearchChange2000]. They appear to do this by loading the objects into working memory and then, in the second frame, checking whether any are different than what is held in memory. A vast literature on visual working memory has confirmed that people can store several objects and rapidly compare these stored representations to the visual scene. However, loading into memory the features of objects for storage and subsequent comparison is not the same as maintaining awareness of the changing features of such objects. For one thing, it appears that hundreds of milliseconds are needed to encode several objects [@vogelTimeCourseConsolidation2006 @ngiamVisualWorkingMemory2019]. Second, it appears that when objects are in motion, updating of their features is particularly poor, as we will see in the next section.

When Zenon Pylyshyn published the first theory of multiple object tracking, he had already devised the concept of FINSTs (Fingers of Instantiation), a small set of discrete pointers allocated to tracked targets. The idea was that each discrete pointer allows other mental processes to individuate and link up with an object representation, with the continued assignment of a pointer to a target facilitating its representation an object's representation as the same persisting individual [@pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989].

Pylyshyn's theory implied that when tracking multiple targets, people should know which target is which. To his credit, Pylyshyn tested this and other predictions of his theory, and when the results turned out differently than he expected, he published his results, in two papers, the first of which was entitled "Some puzzling findings in multiple object tracking: I. Tracking without keeping track of object identities". In one study reported in that paper, targets were assigned identities either by giving them names or by giving them distinct and recognizable starting positions: the four corners of the screen [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2004]. At the end of a trial, participants had the usual task of indicating which objects were targets, but also were asked about the identity of the target - which one it was. Accuracy at identifying the targets was very low, even when accuracy reporting their positions was high. <!-- target-target confusions could explain this -->

More evidence for a disconnect between knowledge of what one is tracking and success at the basic MOT task was found by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007, who had participants track targets with unique appearances - in one set of experiments, they were cartoon animals. At the end of a trial, all the targets moved behind occluders so that their identities were no longer visible. Participants were asked where a particular target (say, the rabbit) had gone - that is, which occluder it was hiding behind. This type of task was dubbed "multiple identity tracking" by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004. Performance was better than chance, but was much worse than performance for reporting the target locations irrespective of which target it was. The effective number of objects tracked, as reflected in a standard MOT question, was about four, but when asked to indicate the final location of a particular animal, capacity was estimated as closer to two objects.

These results of MIT experiments suggest that our ability to update the location of objects of interest is much better than our ability to maintain knowledge of what those objects are. This harkens back to Pylyshyn's original idea that tracking is mediated by pointers that in and of themselves, only point to locations and don't contain other featural information. Pylyshyn thought that these pointers, being unique and distinct, did provide us with knowledge of which target location at the end of a trial corresponded to a particular target at the beginning of a trial. However, his own experiments ruled against that - the tracking process seems to deploy something to the moving targets that carries absolutely no information about those targets other than their positions.

Given enough time, we certainly can update our representation of not only the locations of targets but of their features. For example, in visual short-term memory experiments, on successive trials people memorize different location-feature mappings for several objects. Thus, if moving objects were simply to move very, very slowly, we should be able to update our awareness of what is where before any target travels more than a trivial distance. However, a quite recent study yielded some results that further showcase the limitations of our identity updating abilities.

## Beaten by a bird brain

<!--For instance, @schollRelationshipPropertyencodingObjectbased2001 found that when items stopped moving, observers were able to accurately report the previous direction and speed of targets but not of nontargets. However, when the shape or color of the items was masked, observers were unable to accurately report the premask features of either targets or nontargets.-->

@pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 conducted a test that at an abstract level, was similar to Pylyshyn's experiments, with identical objects assigned unique identities. @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020, however, used a format much like the "shell game" utilised by magicians and hustlers for hundreds of years. The engaging nature of the shell game format made it suitable for testing children and an African grey parrot as well as human adults. This led to a few surprises.

For stimuli, @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 used colored balls of wool. Between one and four of the balls were shown to a participant. The experimenter covered the balls with inverted opaque plastic cups, and then began to move them, swapping the positions of one pair at a time. After a variable number of pairs were swapped, the experimenter presented another ball with one of the target colors, and the participant's task was to point to (or peck on!), the cup containing the probed color. 

![An African grey parrot participates in a shell game. CC-BY Pailian et al. (2020)](imagesForRmd/ParrotGriffinPepperbergShellGame.png){width=40%} 

At any one time, only two objects were in motion, and that the participants were responsible for knowing the final location of all the colors - there were no distractors. One might anticipate that at least the adults would be able to perform this task with high accuracy, especially given that at any one time, only two objects were in motion and the experimenter paused for a full second between swaps, which ought to give people enough time to update their memory of the locations of those two colors.

When only two balls were used, over 95% accuracy was seen even for four swaps, the highest number tested. This was true of all three participant types: the children, the parrot, and the human adults. In the three-ball condition, for the children, who were 6 to 8 years old, performance was still near ceiling for the zero-swap (no movement) condition, but fell to close to 80% correct  in the one-swap condition, and fell to around 70% correct for two and three swaps. The adults did better, but still their performance fell with number of swaps, to about 80% correct for four swaps. Remarkably, the parrot actually outperformed not only the children, but also the human adults. Importantly, the parrot had not been trained extensively on the task, learning it primarily by simply viewing the experimenter and a confederate perform three example trials (the parrot was experienced with a simpler version of the task involving only one object presented under one of the three cups).

The biggest surprise here is that an African gray parrot had the ability to remember and update small sets of moving hidden objects to a level of accuracy similar to humans, despite having a much smaller brain than ours, less than one-fiftieth the size of our own in fact. Because large parts of the parrot brain evolved after they split from our lineage [@iwaniukInterspecificAllometryBrain2005], the existence of this ability in its brain looks to be an example of convergent evolution.

A second surprise was that the adult humans (in this case, Harvard undergraduates, who surely had high intelligence on average) displayed levels of accuracy that was not very high for the conditions that involved more than a few swaps. Remember that in these experiments, only two balls were moved at a time, and there was a one-second pause between swaps. Prior to the publication of this study, I had assumed that the reason for poor performance in multiple identity tracking was the difficulty of updating the identity of three or four targets while they moved. I would have predicted that changing positions exclusively by swapping the positions of two objects, and providing a one-second pause between swaps, would lead to very high performance. The @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 results suggest that updating the memory of object locations is very demanding. 

This finding was also surprising based on the long-accepted concept of "object files" developed by @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992. The idea was that all the features of an object are associated with a representation in memory, the object file, that is maintained even as the object moves. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 showed a preview display with two rectangles, with a feature (in most experiments, a letter) presented in each. The featural information disappears, and then the rectangles would move to a new location. The observer's representation of the display is then probed, for example by presenting a letter again in one of the rectangles and asking participants to identify it. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 
found that if the letter was the same as the one presented in that rectangle at the beginning of the display, observers were faster to respond than if it had appeared in another rectangle in the beginning of the display, indicating that that aspect of the rectangle's initial properties was maintained, with its location updated. The focus in these studies was on simply demonstrating that this response time priming occurred at all, not in assessing what proportion of time it occurred.

Many researchers may have made the same mistake that I did of assuming that several object files could easily be maintained and updated. However, even in the original experiments of @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992, they found that the amount of priming was greatly diminished when four letters were initially presented in different rectangles, indicating that fewer objects than that had letter information maintained and updated. They concluded that there may be a severe capacity limit on object files. This was also supported by a pioneering study by @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002, who had participants view a circular array of colored discs that rotated about the center of the screen. Occasionally discs swapped color when they briefly went behind occluders, and the participants' task was to detect these color switches. Performance decreased dramatically with speed and number of discs, even though the motion was completely predictable, and @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 concluded that "even completely predictable motion severely reduces our capacity of object representations, from four to only one or two." Bcause we now understand that simple MOT does not work well across occluders, however, interpretation of this study is not so simple without an MOT-type control. Nevertheless, the evidence from the studies in this chapter overall suggests that identity updating is very poor in a range of circumstances.

## Some dissociations between identity and location processing reflect poor visibility in the periphery

If it is the case that participants cannot update the identities of the moving objects that they are tracking nearly as well as they can update their positions, why is that? The results of an eye tracking study by the Finnish researchers Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä led them to conclude that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process. Eye movements during MOT were contrasted with those during MIT, in which the targets and distractors were line drawings. During MIT, participants looked directly at targets frequently, totalling around 50% of the trial duration, and frequently moved their eyes from one target to another. In contrast, during MOT, the participants moved their eyes infrequently, and their gaze wasn't usually at any of the moving objects, rather they were usually looking somewhere close to the center of the screen. @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 took these results to mean that the targets' identity-location bindings that must be updated during MIT are updated by a serial one-by-one process, whereas target positions during MOT are updated by a parallel process.

What @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 did not address is that limitations on human peripheral vision mean that participants may have had to update target identity information one-by-one. That is, the targets, line drawings of different objects, likely were difficult to identify when in the periphery. Thus, participants had to move their eyes to each object to refresh their representation of which was which. Indeed, in a subsequent study  @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 tested discriminability of the objects in the periphery and found that accuracy was poor. <!-- The conclusion by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process that determines the movement of the eyes may well be correct.-->
 When they instead used colored discs as stimuli, accuracy was higher in the periphery and participants did not move their eyes as often to individual targets. This suggested at least some degree of parallel processing, leaving the amount of serial processing, if any, in doubt.

<!--@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 did not assess how far in the periphery the target objects were identifiable - the only study I know of that did this is a later paper by the Finnish team, specifically @liModelMultipleIdentity2019. They tested discriminability of line drawings from the same database as those used by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016, while also testing the discriminability of faces and colored discs. More specifically, they first presented a sample stimulus at fixation (either a face, a line drawing, or a colored disc, depending upon the block of trials) and subsequently in the periphery they presented either the same stimulus or another stimulus from the same category. The task of participants was to judge whether this peripherally-presented stimulus was the same or different. For the faces and the line drawings, percent correct decreased a substantial amount with distance from the fovea. However, for the color task, percent correct was the same at all three eccentricities tested (2.5, 5, and 7.5 deg).    Forget a bit about what it looks like. don't have to classify among all the options-->

In summary, many findings of differences between MIT and MOT performance may be explained by poor recognition of the targets in the periphery. Because most studies of MIT do not include an assessment of how recognizable their stimuli are in the periphery (@liModelMultipleIdentity2019 is the only study I know of that did this), it is hard to say how much of the difference between MIT and MOT can be attributed to this. I am not sure how one would equate object localization with object identifiability; the old apples and oranges problem. One could blur the objects to impair localization but it is not clear what degree of spatial uncertainty is comparable to a particular level of object identifiability.

One dissociation between identity and location tracking performance seems to remain valid regardless of the difficulty of perceiving object identities in the periphery. This is the original finding by @pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989, which was replicated by @cohenWhatwhereTradeoffMultipleidentity2011 that if targets are actually identical but are assigned different nominal identities, participants are very poor at knowing which is which at the end of the trial. Because in this paradigm, there is no visible identity information and participants knew this, the resolution of the periphery was not an issue.

## Evidence from two techniques suggests parallel updating of identities

<!-- To some extent, however, we're comparing apples and oranges. This study should be replicated with another sample of participants, however, and using a method that directly compares MIT (knowledge of target identities) to MOT (knowledge of targets' locations) by including distractors, not just targets. Without that, there is some concern that the presence of the experimenter was distracting or that some other idiosyncrasy of the paradigm led to poor identity performance.--> 

<!--These claims of a process that is serial and one-by-one are not based on rigorous tests of serial processing like those progressively elaborated by Jim Townsend and colleagues since the 1980s [@algomFeaturesResponseTimes2015; @townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Rather, it is based on more indirect evidence such as the visual search results that originally led Anne Treisman to propose a serial feature binding process.-->

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a used two techniques to investigate the possibility that serial processes are involved in multiple identity tracking. First, Howe et al. applied the simultaneous-sequential presentation technique that they previously applied to MOT,
as discussed in \@ref(serialOrParallel). For the MIT task, four targets of different colors moved among four distractors. Each of the four distractors was the same color as one of the targets, so that the targets could not be distinguished from the distractors by color. In the simultaneous condition, all the objects moved for 500 ms and then paused for 500 ms, with this cycle repeating throughout the length of the trial (which varied randomly between 8 and 16 s). In the sequential condition, half the targets moved for 500 ms while the other half were stationary, and subsequently the other half of targets moved for 500 ms while the others remained stationary. This cycle repeated throughout the length of the trial. In two different versions of the experiment, performance was similar in the simultaneous and sequential conditions, supporting the conclusion that there was no serial process involved in multiple identity tracking. However, the @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a conclusion is limited by its assumption that any serial process could respond efficiently to the pause in half the targets by shifting its resources to the moving targets, while not causing any forgetting of the locations and identities of the temporarily-stationary targets. To support this assumption, @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a pointed out that @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 had shown that attention could move at much faster rates than 500 ms per shift. However, the @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 did not assess the attention shifting time between unrelated targets, rather their shifts were for attention stepping along with a single target disc as it moved about a circular array. Thus, it is unclear to what extent the results of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a undermine the serial, one-by-one identity updating idea embedded in the theories of Oksama & Hyönä and @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019.

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a further investigated serial versus parallel processing in MIT by using a completely different technique: the systems factorial technology of Jim Townsend and colleagues [@townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Two targets were designated for tracking and presented in the same hemifield, to avoid independence by virtue of the hemispheres' independence [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005]. The participants were told to monitor both targets as they moved and that if either of them darkened, to press the response button as quickly as possible, after which all the disks stopped moving and the participant was asked to identify the location of a particular target, for example the green one (the objects were identical during the movement phase of the trial but initially each was shown in a particular color). To ensure that participants performed the identity tracking task as well, only trials in which the participant reported the target identity correctly were included in the subsequent analysis. Performance detecting the darkening events was very high, at 95% correct. On different trials, either both targets darkened, one of them darkened, or neither of them darkened, and each could darken either by a small amount or by a large amount. <!--Because it's a response time analysis, it's measuring parallel or serial processing, which may be different somehow from possibly serial processing for individuating a target or solving the correspondence problem for it. In that case, the actual processing time is time-limited by the stimulus, whereas you can let a slow parallel accumulator eventually do its thing when the stimulus information isn't time-curtailed. In other words, attention might focus on one because it absolutely has to get done, but that would mean switching its strategy adaptively based on difficulty--> The pattern of the distributions of response time for the various conditions ruled out serial processing (under certain assumptions) and implicated limited-capacity parallel processing. This suggests that participants can process luminance changes of two moving targets in parallel while also maintaining knowledge of the identity of the moving targets. One reservation is that it is unclear how often the participants needed to update the target locations and refresh their identities, because the rate at which they needed to be sampled to solve the correspondence problem is unclear for the particular trajectories used. <!--The fact that identity tracking accuracy was over 95% suggests that the task was easy, but still--> . 
<!--PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THIS, MOMIT 2.0 UPDATED -->

## Eye movements contribute a serial process to tracking tasks

Partially in response to the evidence of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a against serial processing in tracking, Oksama and Hyona, with their Chinese colleague Jie Li, revised their Model of Multiple Identity Tracking (MOMIT) to involve more parallel processing. Specifically, MOMIT 2.0 proposes that the "outputs of parallel processing are not non-indexed locations but proto-objects that contain both location and basic featural information, which can be sufficient for tracking in case no detailed information is required" [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. This is a reasonable response to the evidence, even if it unfortunately means the theory doesn't make as strong predictions, as the role of serial processing is now more vague. In MOMIT 2.0, serial processing is tied to eye movements and is used to acquire detailed visual information for refreshing working memory representations. This "prevents the resolution of the active representations from declining. This is vital for tracking targets that require high-resolution information to be identified and kept distinguishable from other targets." The theory seems to be mute on whether serial processing would be involved if both fixation were enforced and the stimuli were easily identifiable in the periphery.

Here it is sensible to step back and consider the overall role of eye movements in ecological task behavior. People move their eyes on average three times a second, in part because like many other animals, our retina has a specialized part (the fovea) that is adaptive to direct at whatever object we are most interested in at the moment. In natural tasks, it may be rarely the case that all the visual signals of interest are clustered together enough that they can be processed adequately without eye movements. Moreover, animals such as ourselves have strong drives for exploration and vigilance because we evolved in changing environments about which we had only partial knowledge.

Eye movements normally contribute a serial, one-by-one component to processing, because as @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 highlighted, very high-quality information comes from only a single region on the screen - the region currently falling on the fovea. Near-continual scanning of the visual scene is a deeply ingrained habit, and extends to artificial tasks like reading. Not only are saccades  frequent during reading, but one influential theory of reading proposes that an internal rhythm drives saccades from one word to the next rather than them being triggered by the completion of a process such as word recognition [@engbertDynamicalModelSaccade2002]. Perhaps, then, one should expect frequent eye movements to occur and contribute a serial component of processing to a range of tasks even when such eye movements are not necessary. People are also cognitively "lazy" in that they seem to structure eye movements and other actions in tasks so as to minimize short term memory requirements [@hayhoeTaskConstraintsVisual1998]. Thus, even if saccading to different targets were inefficient, people may do it anyway.

To move forward in the perennial debate regarding the role of serial and parallel processing, we must recognize that the serial processing associated with eye movements is likely to occur in many tracking tasks, while people may perform the same task in a parallel fashion when eye movements are constrained. Based on this perspective, the most interesting evidence for serial processing is that which is found with tasks in which eye movements are prohibited. This again highlights the possibly-linear decrease in apparent sampling frequency discovered by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 and reviewed in \@ref(#serialOrParallel).

<!--The Finnish team of Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä may have done the most studies of the task they dubbed multiple identity tracking (MIT) in 2004 [@oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004], introduced above in the version used by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007. Based on results includning those I have reviewed here, since 2008 Oksama and Hyönä have been advocating a model that tracks the locations of moving objects with a parallel process, but updates other featural information with a serial, one-by-one process [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. -->

<!--They say Holcombe & Chen 2013 found big evidence for serial because "when objects move along the same trajectories (e.g., Holcombe & Chen, 2013) and/or are close to each other, high resolution information is required for discriminating the objects.

## Feature differences, but not feature conjunction differences, benefit tracking

<!--Unfortunately, it is difficult to test participants on whether they know during tracking the characteristics of an object when, as soon as the question is asked, they can focus their attention on the probed object and encode its features for report. But some insight into this issue can be gained by considering the studies conducted by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009.-->

A further difference between MOT and MIT is that when objects have different appearances, these differences can actually be used to benefit position tracking (the MOT component of MIT). 

A further complication for understanding the differences between identity updating and 

In their experiments, @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 presented eight moving objects. Tracking performance was better than when the eight objects were different in color or shape than when they were identical. However, in another condition the eight objects were not all distinguishable based on a single feature and instead were distinguished only by their pairing of features, or a "feature conjunction", as @treismanFeatureIntegrationTheory1980 called this situation. That is, in this condition, each object has a unique pair of features, but shared its individual features with at least one other object. <!--create illustration maybe from diagrammeR--> The results now were quite different. Performance was no better than if the objects were all identical. This finding is consistent with Anne Treisman's perspicacious thesis of over forty years ago that focused attention is needed for many sorts of binding. When tracking multiple targets, then, the pairing of the features cannot be used to distinguish targets from distractors. Only in the conditions where feature binding was not necessary did featural differences benefit tracking performance.

Simple feature differences between targets and distractors (as opposed to conjunctions) mean that feature attention can go some way toward distinguishing targets from distractors and thus result in higher accuracy than if targets were identical to distractors. This was part of the conclusion that @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 came to, and fits with a large set of literature on feature attention, showing that one can, for example, enhance the selection of all red objects in the visual field.

An assumption is that any parallel processes are distributed equally among both moving and any temporarily-stationary target, whereas a serial process is reallocated away from the stationary targets during the interval that they are stationary.

Complicating a simple story of parallel location

Because of results like those reviewed above, 

@hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 multiple identity tracking , found a hemifield advantage: " Contrary to expectations, a bilateral advantage was still observed, though it was not as strong as when observers were not required to remember the identities of the targets. This finding is inconsistent with the only model of multiple identity tracking (Oksama & Hyönä, 2008, Cognitive Psychology, 56, 237-283), so we present an alternative account."

-->

Multiple lines of evidence present problems for the story of parallel location processing and serial updating of identities and object features. In section \@ref(serialOrParallel), we saw that the temporal resolution of object tracking declines with the number of targets in a manner that is difficult to explain without resort to a serial account of location updating. To address this, @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 wrote that "when objects move along the same trajectories (e.g., Holcombe & Chen, 2013) and/or are close to each other, high resolution information is required for discriminating the objects. Thus, tracking becomes more serial,". However, I have found nothing in the description of their model that should be hindered by objects sharing a trajectory, and also the objects in Holcombe & Chen (2013) were not close to each other. The parallel location updating element of their theory can be saved, however, by positing that trajectory information is available to a parallel process thanks to motion traces in sensory memory, as we will see in section \@ref(beyondLocation). That process would indeed be hampered by objects sharing a trajectory, on the assumption that trajectories are used not for extrapolation, but for solving the correspondence problem.

In the early 1990s, it gradually became clear that the mind maintained fewer visual representations than researchers had assumed. Failures of trans-saccadic visual fusion and inability to detect changes that occurred during eye movements [@mcconkieRoleControlEye1979] led @oreganSolvingRealMysteries1992a to suggest that "the world is an outside memory" and to discover change blindness [@rensinkSeeNotSee1997]. The idea was that the impression that one has a rich representation of all the objects in the visual field is an illusion, and instead that one has only a more limited knowledge, but that this is quickly supplemented by attentional processing when one becomes interested in a particular location or object.

It appears that O'Regan's big idea goes further than he anticipated. While O'Regan suggested that only when objects  were attended would they be fully processed, he did not suggest that one might be able to track the changing locations of multiple targets without knowing what they are. 



<!--Tracking is important for representing objects still in view @tsubomiNeuralLimitsRepresenting2013-->



<!--
A second factor is that even when objects remain close enough to central vision to resolve their identities, a limited resource is required to bind their features together, including binding individual features with their location... 

A third factor is, of course, the limitations that result in imperfect performance even on tracking identical objects, reviewed in the previous sections..

You can track four objects without being able to identify stuff on the four objects. This could either be explained by attention needing to switch between locations, or alternatively that you just need less resource to track than to identify.

Because binding seems to require sustained attention, it’s unlikely it’s bound when serial attention isn’t there. But you might have a memory index of what is there - I need help on this from VWM people!-->


<!-- ## Configurations and 

Most models of tracking have assumed that people track only the targets, and track them without reference to the positions of any other objects. We know from other areas of research, however, that people rapidly extract that spatial layout or configuration of the objects in a scene. Some research has indicated that configural information is also used for tracking.

@nummenmaaCorticalCircuitBinding2017 found temporal lobe activation

"erhaps most famously, these sorts of processes seem to be localized in anatomically distinct corti- cal streams (e.g., Livingstone and Hubel 1988), with the ventral pathway corresponding to identification, and the dorsal pathway corresponding to individuation. In addition, a variety of behavioral evidence supports this distinction. The surface features of objects (e.g., their colors and shapes), while obviously critical for many visual processes including object recogni- tion, seem to be largely discounted by many other processes (for a review, see Flombaum, Scholl, and Santos, in press). For example, surface features play little or no role in determining apparent motion correspondence (Burt and Sperling 1981), identity over time in the tunnel effect (Flombaum et al., 2004; Flombaum and Scholl 2006; Michotte, Thinès, and Crabbé 1964/1991), or object-specific priming (Mitroff and Alvarez 2007)." [@schollWhatHaveWe2008]

In sport, however, sometimes we are suprised to discover an opponent in the right place at the right time. "Where did he come from?" is a common complaint. This phenomenon can be partially understood in terms of the limit on the number of objects that can be tracked in MOT. It turns out, however, that this is only part of the story. The limitations on tracking are more profound than those we have reviewed so far.

The tracking research we have discussed so far has used targets and distractors that are all identical to each other (after the initial phase where the targets are indicated). In the real world, however, this is uncommon.

Visual short-term memory tasks typically find that people can perform reasonably well at storing at least four objects, allowing participants to detect whether an object changes during a short interval. This, together with the misconception discussed in section \@ref(bottlenecks) that tracking has a limit of four targets has led many researchers to suggest that a common limitation underlies both visual short-term memory and object tracking. This may be true in some sense, but certain possibilities have been ruled out by a dramatic finding.

Putting objects in motion can dissociate tracking and short-term memory capacities. @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 asked participants to track four colored discs that periodically moved behind occluders and then re-appeared on the other side. There were no distractors. The task of participants was to detect whether any discs changed color. Contrary to what would be expected from object files theory [@kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992], for all but very slow speeds, performance was very low. However, because distractors were not included, there was no direct comparison to performance tracking solely the objects' locations (without knowing their colors).

# Abilities, individual differences, dual-task interference {#abilities}

There are two basic approaches to understanding the abilities that underlie multiple object tracking. One is the classic experimental approach of dissociating the processes involved by manipulating different factors within participants. This has been the dominant approach and has led to our present understanding of the roles of spatial interference, temporal interference, and the duration that one can sustain attention. However, a small but growing literature has used the complementary individual-differences approach. In the individual-differences approach, the pattern of variation in scores on multiple tests is examined to see which abilities tend to go together. Those abilities that co-vary the most are thought to likely share more processes in common than those that don't.

## Do people vary much in how many objects they can track?

@meyerhoffDistractorLocationsInfluence2015b tested fifty participants and for each one calculated the effective number of items tracked, for a display with four targets and four distractors, the modal effective number of items tracked was around two, but a substantial proportion of participants's came in at three targets or one target, and a few scored close to zero effective items tracked. 

Unfortunately, in the data of @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020, like that of many others, there is no way to know how much of the variation between individuals is due to motivation rather than ability. Measuring motivation is not easy, but researchers should at least include what are sometimes called attention checks or catch trials to allow exclusion of participants who show clear evidence of not reading the instructions carefully or frequently not paying attention.


For some cognitive tasks, individual differences are small, making an individual-differences approach problematic [@hedgeReliabilityParadoxWhy2018]. @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 made the effort to test 201 participants on MOT, in an effort to examine variation in how many objects people can track with reasonable accuracy. They found what appeared to be a substantial variation in capacity, with some people able to track six objects, while many could track only two or even just one. However, no analyses were reported regarding the reliability of the MOT test. This left open the possibility that the tracking scores were very noisy, such that the variation in scores found between participants could also have been found if just one participant were tested repeatedly.

<!--One way to have assessed reliability would have been to test each participant two times, to exmaine whether individuals would achieve similar scores in the two instances. For any given test, it is possible that a test is instead very noisy, such that at an extreme the variation in scores found between participants would also be found if just one participant were tested repeatedly.

Although they did not vary the number of targets participants had to track, @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, and @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 all tested a large number of participants and calculated the correlation in participants' performance between one half of the trials they were tested in and the other. All three found a high correlation of >0.85.  Together with their other results and those of @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, this indicates that people do vary substantially in their multiple object tracking ability. 

@wilmerMultipleObjectTracking2016 Multiple object tracking predicts math potential

@wilbiksIndividualDifferencesMultiple2020 I haven't read this one but do they account for lapse rate?

Ageing is likely a major source of individual differences, as older participants perform much worse than younger participants [@trickAgerelatedDifferencesMultipleobject2005; @sekulerAgerelatedChangesAttentional2008; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017]. Using a task requiring participants to detect which of multiple objects had changed its trajectory, @kennedyEarlyAgerelatedDecline2009 found a steep decline between 30 and 60 years, where the effective numbers of tracked trajectories during MTT dropped by about 20% with each decade of aging, which could not be explained by a drop in visual acuity. 


Variation in MOT performance is typically interpreted by researchers as variation simply in how many objects a person can track. 

But the underlying reason for variation in MOT performance may not be due to variation in number of FINSTs or some other such capacity, but rather due to variation in peoples' tracking speed limit, spatial interference, or temporal interference. This does not seem to have been properly investigated.


## What tasks are most related to MOT? 

 Large differences have been found in spatial crowding, which probably explains some variance. 
The deleterious effects of crowding also show substantial individual differences [@petrovAsymmetriesIdiosyncraticHot2011], such as larger crowding zones in some types of dyslexia [@jooOptimizingTextIndividual2018], so crowding likely also contributes to some of the inter-individual variation in tracking performance.

Partly to reveal what other sorts of tasks a high ability to track multiple objects indicates, @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 and @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 tested large numbers of participants on several tasks. @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 used a set of cognitive and attentional tasks that he termed conjunction search, configuration search, counting, feature access, spatial pattern, response selection, visual short-term memory, change blindness, Raven's test of intelligence, visual marking, attentional capture, consonance-driven orienting, inhibition of return, task switching, mental rotation, and Stroop. While many of these showed high reliability of over .9, the correlations with MOT were moderate, with the highest being counting at 0.4, which required counting the number of white dots in a brief (400 ms) display. Change blindness, feature access, visual working memory, and visual marking were runner ups with correlations of around 0.3.
<!-- @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 "For each variable, reliability was estimated by calculating the split-half (odd-even) correlations and the Spearman-Brown formula was used for adjustment. All of the 17 paradigms met the minimum reliability of 0.7."  So I guess these are not raw correlations he reports from then on -->

@trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 reported data from more than 400 participants tested online, and tested a set of cognitive, attentional, and common neuropsychological tasks: arithmetic word problems, the trial-making task, digit span, digit symbol coding, letter cancellation, spatial span, approximate number sense, flanker interference, gradual onset continuous performance, spatial configuration visual search, and visual working memory as well as MOT. MOT had among the highest reliabilities, at 0.92. MOT performance had  little correlation with performance on the task designed to measure sustained attention over an extended period (about five minutes, the gradual-onset continual performance task, [@fortenbaughSustainedAttentionLife2015]. This supports the tentative conclusion, already suggested in the "Duration that one can sustain attention" section of this Element, that the ability to sustain attention without lapses is not an important determinant of tracking performance (as was ).

The tasks with the highest correlations with MOT in the data of @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 were visual working memory, spatial span, letter cancellation, and digit symbol coding, all at around 0.5. As the authors pointed out, the letter cancellation and digit symbol coding tasks are complex tasks from neuropsychology that are believed to reflect a number of abilities. This makes it hard to interpret their correlation with MOT. Spatial span and visual working memory are quite different from MOT, but similar to each other in that they both involve short-term memory for multiple visual stimuli.

In the @trevinoBridgingCognitiveNeuropsychological2021 inventory, the task that most resembled the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012, which @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 found had a high correlation with MOT, was the approximate number sense task, with a moderate correlation of 0.3. It differed from the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 by not testing the subitizing (less than 5 items) range, which might help explain any discrepancy. In a more limited study, @eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018 found, using hierarchical regression, that subitizing made a contribution to predicting MOT performance that was somewhat separate to that of an estimation task using larger set sizes. <!-- change blindness, load-induced blindness and multiple object tracking, MOT split-half reliability of .87 -->

Overall, there is a reasonable level of agreement across these individual-differences studies, as well as others not described here, such as @trickSpatialVisuospatialWorking2012. They agree that visual working memory has a robust correlation with MOT performance, which is particularly interesting because superficially, MOT imposes little to no memory demand. Most researchers conceive of tracking as involving allocating multifocal attention to multiple targets simultaneously, with a process autonomous to memory causing the foci of attention to move along with the moving targets. 

"Working memory is a well-established predictor of individual differences in a range of attention tasks, including for example the Stroop task, spatial cuing and task switching (e.g. Kane & Engle, 2001; Kane, Bleckley, Conway & Engle, 2001; Redick & Engle, 2006)."

<!--In Huang et al.’s study, the correlation between MOT and VWM was .30, the correlation between (configuration) search and MOT was .30, and the correlation between search and VWM was .23. In our data, however, MOT and VWM were much more closely correlated with each other (.51)-->

 With the growth of online testing, we can expect this approach to  

## Dual-task

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

The dual-task literature is very large. Can't review it all here

# Real world

**Towards the real-world** and real-world tasks. A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone on the bacsketball court is at all times. Bringing together the factors described in previous sections, and bringing in new ones such as limits on feature binding, we will analyze some real-world tasks.

# Misconceptions and questions

Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.

Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance.

"Our pupil data (see also Alnæs et al., 2014) indicate that both MIT and MOT are attention-demanding (thus ruling out preattentive models, such as FINST of Pylyshyn, 1989), " @oksama

"whereas at high speeds, only one target could be tracked. This is strong evidence against Pylyshyn’s (1989, 2006) account, which predicts that capacity should be constant."

Although CDA findings suggest there is something tracking number of objects rather than resources expended @drewVogel @balabanObjectRepresentationsVisual2016, I don't know that it supports a limit on this

But the CDA suggests there 

At the time of this writing, Pylyshyn's theory is the featured theory on the Wikipedia page for multiple object tracking, and it is frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well.

Further undermines Pylyshyn's conception

Early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992

It is well-known that a decrease with target load, linear or non-linear, can be explained by parallel models as well as serial models.

## Recommendations

Always use several targets, not just two or three, to dilute the influence of C=1 processes.

Always test for hemifield specificity.

The effect increases with retention interval, and may be a more cognitive mechanism, as it has been suggested that  Rep- resentational momentum occurs in memory for implied motion stimuli and  neither of which elicits pursuit eye movements.
