## Abstract

Despite massively parallel processing at the front end of our visual system, our minds are highly limited in how much information can be extensively processed simultaneously. This is usually investigated with unmoving stimuli, but our visual world frequently contains many moving objects. Studies of multiple object tracking (MOT) have revealed that our capacity for updating the representations of objects are more limited than one might expect from studies with static stimuli. In this selective review of the MOT literature,

Cognitive psychologists study this mainly

Our visual world frequently contains multiple moving objects.

Frequently we find ourselves in a visual world of moving objects.

Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?-->

Attention has been a preoccupation of scientific psychology since its modern beginning in the late 19th century. To define attention, William James in 1890 referred to introspective experience, writing that "It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." Implicit in this description is the limited capacity of higher mental operations; James seemed to think their capacity was limited to just one object or train of thought.

```

Hugo Münsterberg, one of the first "natural philosophers" with an actual laboratory that studied attention, was highly interested in attention and moving stimuli. His 1916 book **The Photoplay: A Psychological Study** described his theory of the cinema, and included a twenty-page chapter on attention. He and others were by then were conducting experiments using custom devices that measured response time and presented auditory and visual stimuli.

Decades later, the study of attention ended up on a path dominated by stimuli that did not move. After World War II, when the study of attention grew rapidly, the tachistoscope became the standard laboratory presentation apparatus. It could present a set of stimuli, drawn on a card, very briefly, but was not designed to create motion. Through the 1980s, very few attention researchers used moving stimuli, even as the study of motion grew rapidly among perception researchers.

Psychology laboratories did not use cutting-edge technology. Already in 1980, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced the game Space Invaders to millions of homes, and by 1981, Asteroids was invented. <!-- (https://youtube.com/embed/YJZ0hB0Vnyk) -->

```

Playing both Space Invaders and Asteroids meant shooting and dodging approaching objects. Avoiding a collision seemed to require monitoring more than one object at a time. Nothing like this would be studied scientifically, however, until much later.

A few years before all this, Zenon Pylyshyn was already pondering the possibility of a primitive visual mechanism capable of "indexing and tracking features or feature-clusters" (as he put it in @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; I haven't been able to get copies of the 1970s reports that he mentions) as they moved. By the mid 1980s he was programming an Apple II+ computer to study this. Around the same time, the Apple II+ became an exciting addition to my own household, although my only interest was in playing games and learning a bit about how a computer was programmed.

By 1988, Zenon Pylyshyn and Ron Storm had done a series of experiments on humans' ability to keep track of moving objects [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988]. They had programmed the II+ to create a display with ten identical objects moving on random trajectories, connected to a telegraph key with a timer to record response times. They complemented this  with an early eyetracker which enforced fixation —  movement of the eyes away from fixation triggered termination of a trial. Thus they were able to investigate the ability to covertly (without eye movements) keep track of moving objects.

In the experiments they reported, up to five of the ten moving objects were designated as targets by flashing at the beginning of the trial. The targets then became identical to the remaining moving objects, the distractors, and moved about randomly. It is immediately apparent that one can do this. While viewing the display, people report having the experience of being aware, seemingly continually, of which objects are the targets and how they are moving about. In [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAQM4QJRYV8) embedded below, one is first asked to track a single target to become familiar with the task, and then subsequently four targets are indicated, at different speeds.

```

In addition to their demonstration that people could do the basic task, which in itself is quite important,  @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 also showed that people are limited in how many targets they can faithfully track. In their experiments, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 periodically flashed one of the moving objects, and if that object was a target, the participant was to press the telegraph key. On trials with more targets, errors were much more common — while only 2% of target flashes were missed when only one of the ten objects was a target, 14% of target flashes missed when five of the objects were targets. 

The notion of keeping track of moving objects is familiar from certain situations in everyday life. If you've ever been responsible for more than one child while at a beach or a park, you know the feeling of continuously monitoring the locations of multiple moving objects. If you've ever played a team sport, you may recall the feeling of monitoring the positions of multiple opponents at the same time, perhaps the player with the ball and also a player they might pass the ball to. If you've ever wanted to speak to someone at a scientific conference, you may know the feeling of monitoring the position and posture of that person relative to others they are chatting with, in order to best time your approach.

<!-- On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles.  At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water.--> 
<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move  and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey)-->.

# Summary

## Outline

Today, the study of visual attention is still dominated by experiments with stimuli that don't move. This may have given researches a distorted picture of how attention works. As we'll see, when objects are put in motion, some of the usual benefits of attentional cuing evaporate. This suggests that with static objects, one can bring to bear additional processes, perhaps cognitive processes, that are only clearly dissociated from lower-level processes by using objects in motion.

One of my motivations for writing something of this length was to lay out a conceptual framework that would facilitate further progress. This involves addressing some common misconceptions about tracking and highlighting the most   
 striking discoveries about tracking; the findings that are likely to most constrain theories. These are:

* People don't know which target is which (abysmal updating of non-location features)
* Tracking capacity is hemifield specific (one can double capacity by dividing targets between the hemifields)
* Predictability of movement paths benefits tracking, but only for one or two targets, not for more
* Temporal resolution gets worse as number of targets increases, spatial resolution not so much

To put these findings in context, I have organized this book into the following chapters:

* Understanding bottlenecks, resources, and capacity 
* The biggest myth of object tracking <!--And explaining the concept.-->
* Data limitations and resource limitations
* Spatial interference
  * say that I think it's largely temporal interference, which is explained in a forthcoming paper
* A complication with understanding the capacity limit - unitary cognition
* Two brains or one
* Grouping / objects
* Knowing where but not what
* Abilities and individual diffs
* Progress and recommendations

In Chapter \@ref(recommendations) I list some of what's left out and where to learn more. 





Most cognitive psychology researchers have, however, heard a few things about object tracking. But much of what they probably heard is wrong. In this book, we'll bust a few myths about tracking and see that studying it has yielded some unique insights about our limited capacities.
<!--
Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.
-->

<!--Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

Without continuous attentional selection, you not only lose your children

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens. 
-->


<!--
**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.

# Bottlenecks, resources, and capacity {#bottlenecks}

Quickly, what is fourteen times eleven? Calculating that in your head probably takes you a few seconds or more. And if I set you two problems rather than just one, for example by asking you to also divide sixty-eight by seventeen, I'm sure you would do those problems one at a time. Indeed, our minds may be completely incapable of doing two such problems simultaneously [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002; @zylberbergBrainRouterCortical2010a].

Such limitations are remarkable given that each of our brains contains more than 80 billion neurons. The problem is not a lack of neurons, really, but how they are arranged - our mental architecture.

Multiplying and dividing two-digit numbers feels like a rather abstract problem, and not something we do each day. So you might think that if we were doing lots of such problems each day, we could do more than one at a time. This is probably wrong - consider that a task we do have daily practice with is reading. Yet despite years of reading dozens if not hundreds of words a day, a large body of evidence suggests that humans can read at most only a few words at a time, and much research further indicates that we can really only read *one* word at a time [@whiteEvidenceSerialProcessing2018; @reichleEncodingMultipleWords2009]. It seems, then, that at least some of the bottlenecks of human information processing are a fixed property of our processing architecture.

To flesh out the way I'm using the word 'bottleneck', consider a standard soft drink bottle. Most of the volume of the soft drink is in the bottom, wider part of the bottle. If you invert the bottle, most of its liquid contents will press down on the  neck. The narrowness of the neck restricts the rate at which the contents can exit the bottle. Similarly, a large volume of signals from sensory cortex ascending the cortical hierarchy would press up against higher areas that are more limited in capacity. The large volume of visual signals is partly a result of the retinotopic organization of the retina and sensory cortex - each has multiple neurons dedicated to each bit of the visual field, all working in parallel. 

The parallel processing happening in sensory cortices gets a number of tasks done, so that higher stages can save the trouble. These tasks include the encoding of motion direction throughout the visual field, as well as color and orientation. A local and regional differencing operation happens for these features, resulting in salience, such that odd features become conspicuous in our visual awareness. In the below display, for example, you should be able to find the blue objects very quickly.

```{r findBlue, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Thanks to featural attention, you should be able to find the blue circles very quickly.", fig.height = 2.0, fig.width=2.5}
#bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png ?
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
pts<- expand.grid(x = seq(2,16,2), y = seq(2,16,2), type = c("distractor"))
jittr<-.4
pts$x <- pts$x + runif(length(pts$x))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$y <- pts$y + runif(length(pts$y))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$type <- as.character(pts$type)
pts$type[c(1,4,6,8,11,12,13,16,20,25,26,30,33,37,41,44,47,48,52,55,59,60)] <- "distractor2"
pts$type[c(13,26,46)] <- "target"

ymin<-600; ymax<-2000
ggplot(pts,aes(x=x,y=y, color=type)) + geom_point(size=6)  +  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "none")
#+ ylim(ymin,ymax)
```

Orienting mechanisms direct attention to colors or orientations that differ from their surroundings. This is only possible because massively-parallel retinotopic brain areas have orientation- and color-tuned neurons. For other judgments, higher, post-bottleneck brain areas that are very limited in capacity are critical. The visual word form area of in the occipitotemporal sulcus of the left hemisphere needed to recognize words is one example [@whiteParallelSpatialChannels2019]. Being limited in processing capacity to just one stimulus, the word-recognizing process will not recognize a word in a crowded scene until something directs to it the visual signals from a word. We often use the term *selective attention* to refer to this "something" that directs particular visual signals through the bottleneck to limited-capacity processes. <!--Different visual abilities seem to have different capacities, and it is not at all clear that a common selective attention process is responsible for gating all of their inputs.--> If there were no bottlenecks, there would be no need for selection, until the point of action [@allportSelectionActionBehavioral1987].

So far the picture I have painted is one of entirely feed-forward processing, with a torrent of visual signals impinging on a narrow bottleneck of signals that continue onward. But cortical processing is rarely a one-way street, and the way visual attention works is no exception. Visual attention seems to work in large part by biasing processing within visual cortices, rather than leaving that unchanged and blocking all but a few signals at a later bottleneck stage. It may be the limits on the control signals from high-level (possibly parietal) cortex that restrict processing capacity as much as does a structural convergence of visual signals as they penetrate the brain.

A resource metaphor is more apt if limited capacity is a result of a finite pool of neural resources in parietal cortex that biases which visual signals are cognitively processed. I suspect that neither way of thinking is entirely correct. Restricted neural populations for controlling visual processing may be a limiting factor, but so may be neural convergence, amounting to a bottleneck-like aspect of neural architecture. Thus I will sometimes use the term "limited resource" when referring to how we are restricted in how many visual representations are processed.

The word "resource" has the useful connotation that people can choose how to apply their finite processing capacity, as a resource is something that is available and can be used in different ways. For example, it suggests that one can use three-quarters of one's processing capacity for one target while using the other quarter for a second target. As mentioned previously, there is evidence that people can favor one target over another when tracking both [@chenResourceDemandsObject2013; @croweGoaldirectedUnequalAttention2019].

While word recognition seems to be able to process only one stimulus at a time, other visual judgments may be limited in capacity relative to sensory processing, but have a capacity greater than one. Object tracking seems to be one such ability. Certainly by the coarse performance measures typicaly used in the literature, the processing involved in tracking multiple objects seems to be simultaneous, although researchers haven't fully ruled out the possibility that tracking multiple objects happens via a one-by-one process that rapidly switches among the tracked objects.

The existence of very limited-capacity processes illuminates why object tracking is important. By having the location of moving objects of interest in mind, we are able to rapidly deploy all our attentional resources to any one of the objects. This allows more limited-capacity processes to deliver rapid results. <!-- seems to be necessary to, for example, make fine shape discriminations or recognize a word.-->

<!--A major misconception about object tracking has become widespread, and it relates to the nature of tracking's capacity--> limit. <!--See the next section.-->

<!--CROSS-CHECK WITH PSYC2016 TEXT
@duncanSelectiveAttentionOrganization1984 was interested in how many objects we can process at a time. He found that accuracy for making a simple visual judgment about an object was much worse when one needed to simultaneously make a judgment about another. For example, participants were asked to judge whether a briefly-presented rectangle was small or large and also judge whether a simultaneously presented line was dotted or dashed. Performance was worse FOR the two-object condition even in comparison to a single-object condition where two judgments also needed to be made. The participants had to make either two judgments about a single object or one judgment about one object and the second judgment about a different object. To Duncan, his finding that performance was substantially worse in the two-object condition indicated the existence of a bottleneck at a stage that processes objects. He wrote that 

> Findings support a view in which parallel, preattentive processes serve to segment the field into separate objects, followed by a process of focal attention that deals with only one object at a time.

This conclusion was an over-reach. Performance was better than one would expect if only one object were processed, unlike what has been found for word processing. Duncan could explain that by saying that the presentation time was adequate for focal attention to, on *some* trials, process more than one object. Alternatively, however, it may be that the relevant processes *can* handle two objects at a time, but they do so more poorly than for one object. Work that credibly claims that a visual ability is truly limited to one object at a time is hard to find; the reading of words may be an exception.-->

# The biggest myth of object tracking {#biggestMyth}

The issue of how many objects we can track is an important one for understanding tracking's role in natural behavior as well as the performance of laboratory tasks. Unfortunately, some major misconceptions about this have become widespread. As examples, when writing about the "object tracking system", @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 stated that "One of the defining properties of this system is that it is limited in capacity to three to four individuals at a time", and @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006 wrote that "People’s ability to attentively track a number of randomly moving objects among like distractors is limited to four or five items"  <!--cites Pylyshyn Storm 1989-->  <!-- which cites Scholl's objects paper which makes the claim of 4 FINSTs but backs it up only with STM etc. type studies -->. This is a myth, one that is perpetuated by more recent papers with statements like "participants can track about four objects simultaneously" [@vanderburgChangesNotDifferences2019]<!-- (see Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005, for a review; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988)-->

Two claims are often behind these statements, as is evident in the more explicit statements of @doranRoleVisualAttention2010, who wrote that "the main finding" from the object tracking literature "is that observers can accurately track approximately four objects and that once this limit is exceeded, accuracy declines precipitously." The first claim is that there is a constant limit of around four objects, and the second is that accuracy declines precipitously when the limit is reached. The vaguer statements in other papers, such as "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked"  [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007] and "people typically can track four or five items" @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011 <!--cites Pylyshyn 1989--> tend to support both beliefs in the mind of an unsuspecting reader. For each of the quotations in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph, I have checked the evidence provided, and the papers cited, as well as the papers those cited papers cite. Each paper provides no evidence supporting the claim that performance decreases very rapidly once the number of targets is increased above some value. A gradual decrease in performance is seen as number of targets is increased, with no discontinuity; not even a conspicuous inflection point. For example, @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004, one of the papers sometimes cited in this context, tested from two targets to six targets <!--among twelve identical objects in total-->. After the five-second phase of random motion of the objects, one object was flashed repeatedly and participants hit a key to indicate whether they thought it was one of the targets. The proportion of trials in which participants were wrong increased steadily with target size, from 3% incorrect with two targets, to 16% incorrect with six targets.<!--Note that even with six targets, participants were performing substantially better than would be expected if they could only track one or two and had to guess on the others.-->

@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 may be the paper most frequently invoked when a limit of four objects is claimed. But @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 found a quite gradual decrease in performance (their Figure 1) as the number of targets was increased from one to five, and five was the most targets that they tested. And nowhere did @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 state that there is a value beyond which performance declines rapidly. In 1994, early in a paper @pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994 wrote that people can track "at least four" objects, but later in the paper they made a statement that could be interpreted as suggesting a limit of four objects, writing that it is "possible to track about four randomly moving objects" [@pylyshynMultipleParallelAccess1994]. I suspect that this sort of slide toward backing a hard limit is caused in part by the desire for a simple story. It may also stem from an unconscious oversimplification of one's own data, as well as the theoretical commitment of Pylyshyn to the idea that tracking is limited by a set of discrete mental pointers.

Recall that this myth is associated with two claims, both that there is a "limit" after which performance decreases rapidly, and  that this limit is consistently found to be about four. Because the published evidence indicates that the first claim is completely false, let's put that aside and consider a soft version of the second claim, one that seems plausible. Specifically, is it the case that tracking performance falls to some particular level, such as 75% correct, at about four targets, even if this does not mark a hard limit or inflection point? And instead of a performance criterion like 75%, one might alternatively use a criterion like the halfway point from ceiling to chance [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013], or the "effective number of items tracked", calculated by applying a formula to percent correct with the number of targets and distractors [@schollWhatVisualObject2001]. Charitably, this may be what @alvarezHowManyObjects2007 meant when they wrote: "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992)", and the early studies they cited are arguably compatible with this statement. <!-- Alvarez & Franconeri (2007)  "researchers have consistently found that approximately 4 objects can be tracked (Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001; Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Yantis, 1992). The similarity of these estimates, combined with the frequency with which 4-item limits arise in other attention tasks, suggests the possibility that there is a “magical number 4” in visual attention (Cowan, 2001; Pylyshyn, 1989)."  neither said any such thing, it seems from my reading of those papers, e.g.  Pylyshyn & Storm 1988 only went up to 5 out of 10 and there was gradual decrease in performance all the way through. --> <!-- Papers I have checked for the 4-object claim: Cowan, 2001 claimed it for MOT, citing Pylyshyn et al. 1994, which does say "experiments showing that observers can simultaneously track some three to five identical target items" but then when he describes the studies he doesn't say they show that, even though in the discussion he says "One is that it is possible to track about four randomly moving objects" -->
<!-- In some cases the problem stems from Scholl Pylyshyn Feldman paper that devised the effective tracking capacity measure assuming 100% accuracy for one object and delivering a single number, often 4, for effective number tracked--> However, work published over the last fifteen years has revealed this to be an artifact of researchers using similar display and task characteristics. That is, findings that approximately four objects can be tracked based on some performance criterion are arguably just an accident of researchers using similar display parameters. One of the most salient of these parameters is object speed.

The enormous influence of object speed in conventional trackig displays was made clear by @alvarezHowManyObjects2007, who tested participants with a display of sixteen wandering discs. The fewer the number of discs designated as targets, the faster the participants could track each target. In other words, when there were only a few targets, participants could track them even when they moved at high speeds. At very high speeds, participants could track only one object with reasonable accuracy. This indicated that the truth of the idea that participants can track four objects is entirely dependent on the speed of those objects. Additional evidence for this was found by my lab, among others [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @feriaSpeedHasEffect2013]. Soon, a few other display parameters that strongly affect the number of objects that can be tracked were discovered, in particular object spacing [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008; @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. <!--As we will be discussed extensively in section \@ref(twoBrains), one aspect of spacing is that tracking performance can depend greatly on whether the targets are distributed between the left and right hemifields or instead are confined to one hemifield.--> 

In summary, it is incorrect to say that people can track about four moving objects, or even that once some number of targets is reached, performance declines very rapidly with additional targets. The number that can be tracked is quite specific to the display arrangement, object spacing, and object speeds. If a researcher is tempted to write that "people can track about four objects", they should stipulate that this refers to certain tasks, display characteristics, and performance measures<!--something that I have almost never seen in the literature.-->

This same issue of how to characterize a human cognitive limit has long bedeviled the study of short-term memory, a literature in which the most famous papers is arguably "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information" [@millerMagicalNumberSeven1956]. At an international workshop in 2013, two dozen working memory researchers met to develop "benchmarks for models of working memory". One of the issues they grappled with was how to characterize the limit on how many items people can remember. In the paper that came out of the workshop, the researchers pointed out that "observed item limits vary substantially between materials and testing procedures" [@oberauerBenchmarksModelsShortterm2018]. They suggested, however, that much of this variability could be explained by humans' ability to store groups of items as "chunks" and thus the group endorsed a statement that there is a limit of "three to four chunks" [@cowanMagicalNumberShortterm2001a]. In the case of short-term memory, then, the observed variability in experiments' results can potentially be explained by a common underlying limit of three to four chunks that manifests as different observed item limits depending on circumstances (in particular, the opportunity for chunking).

In the case of MOT, it is possible that researchers will be able to identify a set of circumstances that consistently yield a mean tracking limit, in the modal human, of three or four targets, if "limit" is defined as performance falling to a particular level on some performance metric. Probably these circumstances will simply be certain spacings, speeds, object trajectories, and number of objects in a display. It would be nice if some underlying construct, the counterpart of memory's "chunks", would be identified to explain how performance changes when other circumstances are used. That would constitute real progress in theory development. However, I don't see anything like that in the literature currently.

<!-- At this point,  to defend the claim that people can track "about four objects" is to suggest that the studies that have found four targets to be the number that can be tracked . Is there something special about  these speeds. Nobodh justified them with ecological analysis-->

## Different tasks, same limit?

Even with the idea that there is a particular number of objects one can track discarded, there remains a related claim, one common in the literature, that might remain viable. This claim is frequently tangled up in the myth reviewed above, for example it may be stated as the idea that there is a "magical number four". After discarding the attachment to the idea of a number that does not vary with circumstances, the remaining notion is that very different tasks have the same number-of-objects limit when tested in comparable circumstances. For example, @bettencourtSharedFilteringProcesses2011 stated that visual short-term memory and <OT show "an equivalent four-object limit", and @piazzaNeurocognitiveStartupTools2010 similarly claimed that visuo-spatial short-term memory, ultra-rapid counting (subitizing), and multiple object tracking share a common limit of "three or four items".

Perhaps the leading candidate for a hard limit in cognitive psychology is the "subitizing" or near-exact numerosity perception limit mentioned in the previous chapter. Many researchers consider the idea of a sudden decrease in accuracy when the number of objects shown goes from less than four to more than four as well-supported [@revkinDoesSubitizingReflect2008]. Four objects and fewer is frequently referred to as the "subitizing range", with performance approximately as good for rapidly counting four objects as it is for two or one. Note that this is very different than in tracking, for which speed thresholds decline rapidly from one to two targets, as well as to three and four. For visual working memory, which as we mentioned several experts have characterized as being limited to three or four chunks, whether there is a discontinuity after four objects or at any point remains highly debated [e.g. @robinsonThereCapacityAssessing2020].

Overall then, it is doubtful that tasks such as object tracking, visual working memory, and subitizing can be said to have a common limit. Ideally someone would assess this by measuring the limits for all three tasks using the same stimuli, but it is unclear how to equate the information available across tasks. Especially difficult is comparing performance with the briefly-presented static stimuli used in subitizing and working memory tasks to the extended exposures of moving stimuli needed to assess object tracking. A stronger understanding of the processes mediating tracking would be required to model performance of the two tasks using a common framework via which they could be compared at an underlying psychological construct level. However, another approach is to measure the tasks of interest in large numbers of individuals and see whether the different task limits strongly co-vary between individuals. The findings from this approach are reviewed in section \@ref(abilities).

<!-- https://psyc2016.whatanimalssee.com/bottlenecks.html#a-bottleneck-for-object-judgments -->

<!--Working off the dominant framing, that each person does have a specific number of targets they can track which determines percent correct for each level of number of targets, some MOT researchers report what @schollWhatVisualObject2001 called the "effective number of items tracked". The associated formula, refined by @hullemanMathematicsMultipleObject2005a allows researchers to calculate the effective number of items tracked based on accuracy in an individual condition, given the number of targets and distractors in that condition. This does provide a useful summary of the data, but researchers should take more care to avoid taking it literally.--> <!--Still, it does seem that the number four pops up more than would be expected if these abilities were unrelated. -->

To summarize this chapter, there are three common misconceptions about what has been shown about object tracking. The one that we have just discussed is that different tasks show the same limit. This may actually be true, but I know of no research that have used the same display and task settings to adequately back this up. In the previous section of this chapter, we saw that it is not justified to say that as the number of targets is increased to about four, performance falls to a certain criterion level. One must specify particular display and task characteristics in order to make that statement true. A final misconception is that performance falls very rapidly when one increases the number of targets past a particular number (the "limit").

Given that tracking performance does depend greatly on circumstances and falls gradually rather than displaying a discontinuity at a particular target number, what are the implications for how tracking works?

<!--chapter:end:theBiggestMyth.Rmd-->

# Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance? {#whichAspects}

While Pylyshyn theorized that tracking is accomplished by a fixed and discrete set of pointers, the dependence on display characteristics of the number of objects one can track hints that the underlying process may be continuous and flexible rather than determined by a fixed, discrete set. Based on the flexible resource metaphor, a person might be able to apply more resource to particular targets to reduce the deleterious influence of object speed or another factor. There is good evidence for this [e.g. @chenResourceDemandsObject2013], which will be discussed later, but here I would like to explain the resource concept more, and make an important distinction.

To understand why we can track several objects in some circumstances, but only a few in others, we must distinguish between display factors that impose *data* limitations on tracking, and display factors that impose *resource* limitations. <!--We've already covered C=1 processing, grouping, and the nature of the objects themselves, in Chapters \@ref(objects) and \@ref(grouping).-->

The "data" in data limitation refers to sensory data [@normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975]. If a target moving on an unpredictable trajectory moves outside the edge of our visual field, it is the absence of data that prevents it from being tracked. No amount of mental resources can overcome having no data, at least for an unpredictable stimulus. Data limitations may also occur when sensory signals are impoverished, even if not entirely absent. For example, it is a data limitation that prevents tracking when an object travels at such a fast rate that our neurons hardly register it. So, by data here we are referring not to the raw activation pattern of our photoreceptors, but rather the visual signals available after additional preattentive sensory processing.

People with poor visual acuity may perform less well on a task than people with high visual acuity, due to differences in the sensory data that they have to work with. Thus, some individual differences are almost certainly due to data limitations rather than variation in tracking processes between people. When performance is data-limited, bringing more mental resources to bear provides little to no benefit. The most popular way of investigating this is by varying the number of stimuli one needs to process, as in visual search studies. If the number of stimuli one must evaluate does not affect how well a person can perform a task, this suggests that the task is data-limited rather than resource-limited, because performance is evidently the same regardless of the proportion of the putative resource can be devoted to it. <!-- More reflections on the relation of the resource concept to underlying mechanisms is in Chapter \@ref(spatialInterference). --> 

Resource-limited processing is typically more interesting for those interested in visual attention and the capacity limits on mental processing. If response time or error rate increases with the number of distractors presented in a visual search task, that is classically interpreted as meaning that a resource-limited process is required for success at the task. However, science is hard - an elevation in e.g. error rate can also occur even if there is no resource limitation, if each additional distractor has a non-zero probability of being mistaken for a distractor, yielding more errors with more distractors even if the probability of successfully evaluating each individual stimulus remains unchanged [@palmerAttentionVisualSearch1995]. 

The particular number of objects that can be tracked with reasonable accuracy is thus highly dependent on stimulus conditions, and some of these conditions may reflect data limitations rather than a resource limitation. Still, even in ideal conditions it seems clear that the number of objects that can be tracked is much less than the number of objects that are simultaneously processed by early visual areas. In other words, there is some sort of resource limitation.

We'd like to know what factors consume the resource. I'll also be using the term "resource-intensive" - if a deleterious stimulus factor is resource-intensive, that means that increasing the amount of resource devoted to the stimulus can compensate for that stimulus factor. One example is speed of the moving targets. An increase in targets' speed can hinder performance, but reducing the number of targets, which provides more resource to the remaining targets, can make up for that. Moreover, if one object moves faster than another, it consumes more resource. The evidence for that is that the addition of a fast-moving target hurts tracking performance for a first target more than does the addition of a slow-moving target 

Speed, then, appears to be resource-intensive. Speed also can result in a data-limitation, at very high speeds, but long before such speeds are reached, speed is resource-intensive.

One should not assume, however, that when one manipulates something about a display, that something is the only thing that changes. Increasing the speed of the objects in a display can also result in more close encounters between targets and distractors, unless one shortens the duration of the trial to equate the total distance the objects travel. Thus, it could be that dealing with spatial interference is what consumes resource, rather than speed.  This brings us to the next chapter, which is all about spatial interference.

<!--chapter:end:whichAspects.Rmd-->

# Spatial interference {#spatialInterference}

Details of the world that are much smaller than ourselves, like the fibers that make up paper, or the individual ink blotches laid down by a printer, are inaccessible to the naked eye. This is a familiar limit on our visual abilities, one that is measured when we go to the optometrist. Line segments or objects that are too close together are experienced as a single unit.

Even when two objects are spaced far apart enough that we perceive them as two objects rather than one, they are not processed entirely separately by the brain. Receptive fields grow larger and larger as visual signals ascend the visual hierarchy, and this can result in a degraded representation for objects that are near each other. This is an example of spatial interference.

<!--Decades before @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 conducted experiments on the selection of multiple locations with different densities, researchers had recognized the existence of spatial interference in dense displays-->
A large body of psychophysical work has investigated how spatial interference impairs object perception at high display densities [e.g., @wolfordPerturbationModelLetter1975; @korteUberGestaltauffassungIm1923; @strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014].

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "When one gazes at the central dot, the central letter to the left is not crowded, but the central letter to the right is."}

```

In the above display, if you gaze at the central dot, you likely will be able to perceive the middle letter to the left fairly easily as a 'J'. However, if while keeping your eyes fixed on the central dot you instead try to perceive the central letter to the right, the task is much more difficult. This spatial interference phenomenon is called "crowding" in the perception literature.

Most studies of crowding ask participants to identify a letter or other stationary target when flanking stimuli are placed at various separations from the target. The separation needed to avoid crowding varies depending on the display spatial arrangement, but on average is about half the eccentricity of the target; the interference diminishes rapidly as separation increases beyond that [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970; @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011]. In the display above, for example, the letters on the same side as the 'J' are separated from it by more than half the 'J's distance from the fixation point, so they have little to no effect on its identification. Setting the targets and distractors in motion has little effect [@bexShapeSizeCrowding2003].

When flankers are presented close to a target, they not only prevent identification of the target, they can also prevent the target from being individually selected by attention, and apparently also for multiple object tracking [@intriligatorSpatialResolutionVisual2001]. When a target and distractor are too close to be distinguished by tracking processes, the tracking process may end up tracking a distractor rather than the target.

Crowding happens frequently in the displays typically used by MOT researchers, in that in most experiments, objects are not prevented from entering the targets' crowding zones (as mentioned above, about half the stimulus' eccentricity). It is not surprising, then, that in typical MOT displays, greater proximity of targets and distractors is associated with poor performance [@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008; @tombuAttentionalCostsMultipleobject2008].

## Spatial interference does not explain why tracking many targets is more difficult than tracking only a few

<!-- MOVE TO PREFACE TO SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL INTERFERENCE The errors in MOT occur largely when a target and a distractor come close to each other, in space or in time. During a close encounter between a target and a distractor, one may end up tracking the distractor rather than the target.
 @baeCloseEncountersDistracting2012 @drewSwappingDroppingElectrophysiological2012 -->

In 2008, Steven Franconeri and colleagues claimed that spatial interference is the *only* reason why performance is worse when more targets are to be tracked [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008]. In the previous chapter, we introduced the idea of a resource that, divided among more targets, results in worse tracking performance, Franconeri suggested that this does not exist, or at least, for tracking the only thing that becomes depleted with more targets is the area of the visual field not undergoing inhibition; the inhibition stemming from the inhibitory surround that surrounds each tracked target [@franconeriEvidenceSpeedLimit2008; @franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013; @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010]. The inhibitory surrounds of nearby targets interfere with each other. A provocative implication of their theory, they pointed out, was that "there is no limit on the number of trackers, and no limit per se on tracking capacity" (@franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010, p.920); a very large number of targets could be tracked because as long as targets could be kept far from each other, they could be tracked. Joining Franconeri in making this claim was Zenon Pylyshyn himself as well as other senior visual cognition researchers including James Enns, George Alvarez, and Patrick Cavanagh, my PhD advisor.

In testing this theory, @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010 unfortunately did not isolate the separation between objects from other display variables. MOT studies generally rarely control the retinal separation among the objects in a display, even when they require participants to fixate at the display center. @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010, for example, kept object trajectories nearly constant in their experiments but varied the total distance traveled by the objects (by varying both speed and trial length), on the basis that if close encounters were the only cause of errors, they should be proportional to the total distance traveled. The result was that performance did decrease with distance traveled, but there was little effect of the different object speeds and trial durations that they used. This was taken as strong support for the theory that only spatial proximity mattered. As @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010 stated, their hypothesis that "barring object-spacing constraints, people could reliably track an unlimited number of objects as fast as they could track a single object" constituted a "simple and falsifiable hypothesis". 

To test Franconeri's simple and falsifiable hypothesis, in 2012 my student Wei-Ying Chen and I conducted several experiments. We kept the objects in a display widely separated to avoid the spatial interference that Franconeri claimed was the only factor that could prevent people from tracking many targets. In one experiment, we used an ordinary computer screen but created a wide-field display by having participants bring their noses quite close to it. This allowed us to keep targets and distractors dozens of degrees of visual angle from each other [@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012]. The basic display configuration is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:HC2012BasicTrial).

```{r HC2012BasicTrial, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="In experiments by Holcombe and Chen (2012), after the targets were highlighted in white, all the discs became red and revolved about the fixation point. During this interval, each pair of discs occasionally reversed their direction. After 3–3.8 s, the discs stop, one ring is indicated, and the participant clicks on one disc of that ring."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/HolcombeChen2012BasicTrial.png")
```

We found that even when all the objects in the display were extremely widely-spaced, speed thresholds declined dramatically with the number of targets. To us, this appeared to falsify the theory of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010. For the 2011 Vision Sciences Society conference where we reported these findings, we entitled our poster "The resource theory of tracking is right! - at high speeds one may only be able to track a single target (even if no crowding occurs)". What we meant was that each target takes up some of a very limited processing capacity - a resource that was attentional in that it could be applied anywhere in the visual field, or at least anywhere within a hemifield (\@ref(twoBrains)). The amount of this resource applied to a target determines the fastest speed at which a target can be tracked.

Unconvinced by the findings of Wei-Ying Chen and I, Franconeri et al. (who did not say why) continued to push their spatial interference theory of tracking, and moreover they took the idea of spatial interference much further, suggesting that the same basic idea could also explain capacity limits on object recognition, visual working memory, and motor control, writing that "competitive interactions are the roots of capacity limits for tasks such as object recognition and multiple object tracking” (p.2) and that capacity limits arise only because "items interact destructively when they are close enough for their activity profiles to overlap" (p.2) [@franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013]. Yet to explain the @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 results, the spatial interference posited by Franconeri would have to extend over a very long distance, farther than anything that had been reported in behavioral studies. Furthermore, if there were such long-range spatial gradients of interference present, they should have shown up in the results of @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 as worse performance for the intermediate spatial separations we tested than for the largest separations.

@franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 addressed these problems with their theory in a reply to a letter I wrote in response to @franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013. @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 pointed to neurophysiological recordings in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of rhesus macaque monkeys. A study by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010, presented monkeys with a stimulus and the monkey was subsequently cued to execute a saccade to that stimulus by offset of the fixation point. In some trials another stimulus was flashed 50 ms prior to the offset of the fixation point. That flashed stimulus, which was positioned in the receptive field of an LIP cell the researchers were recording from, allowed researchers to show that the LIP cell's response was suppressed relative to trials with no saccade target. This was true even when the saccade target was very distant - statistically significant impairment was found for separations as large as 40 deg for some cells. There was a spatial gradient to this interference, but the data suggested it could be quite shallow, allowing @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 to write that "levels of surround suppression are strong at both distances, and thus no difference in performance is expected" for the separations tested by Holcombe and Chen (2012). @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 was published as an "online comment" at _Trends in Cognitive Sciences_, as a reply to my letter that the editor had also suggested I post as an online coment. Unfortunately, some time later both comments were lost by the publisher, Elsevier, when they migrated their system. In the case of my comment, I found an old draft on my computer, updated it slightly, and posted it at @holcombeCommentCapacityLimits2019.

The neural suppression documented by @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 has one property that strongly suggests it is not one of the processes that limit our ability to track multiple objects. Specifically, @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 found that nearly as often as not, the location in the visual field that yielded the most suppression was *not* in the same hemifield as the receptive field center. But as we will see in \@ref(twoBrains), the cost of additional targets in attentional tracking is largely independent in the two hemifields. Evidently, then, LIP suppression is not what causes worse performance when there are more targets. Instead, as @falknerSurroundSuppressionSharpens2010 themselves concluded, these LIP cells may help mediate a global (not hemifield-specific) salience computation for prioritizing saccade or attentional targets, wherever they are in the visual field.

In light of all the above, it seemed the evidence ruled against the idea that spatial interference was the sole reason that people perform worse with more targets. Moreover, to accommodate the results we reported in  @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012, the spatial interference account advocated by @franconeriResourceTheoryNot2013 seemed to have been watered down until it was practically indistinguishable from a conventional resource theory – if spatial interference extended over an entire visual field (or hemifield) with no detectable diminution at large separations relative to small separations, then it no longer seemed appropriate to refer to it as "spatial" interference. Instead, finite processing capacity might be both a more parsimonious and straightforward description.

Having failed to find evidence for long-range spatial interference, I decided to investigate the form of spatial interference that I was confident actually existed: short-range interference. Previous studies of tracking did not provide much evidence about how far that interference extended - either they did not control eccentricity (e.g., @feriaSpeedHasEffect2013) or they only tested a few separations (e.g., @tombuTrackingPlanetsMoons2011). 

In experiments published in 2014, we assessed tracking performance for two targets using several configurations and separations between the targets' trajectories [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. Performance improved with separation, but only up to a distance of about half the target's eccentricity, similar to what was found in the literature on crowding  [@strasburgerDancingLettersTicks2014]. In a few of our experiments there was a trend for better performance even as separation increased beyond the crowding zone, but this effect was small and not statistically significant. These findings supported my suspicion that spatial interference is largely confined to the crowding range, and that the performance deficit when there are more targets to track is caused by a limited processing resource.

The experiments we reported in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did yield one finding that surprised us. In the one-target conditions, outside the crowding range we found that performance *decreased* with separation from the other pair of (untracked) objects. This unexpected cost of separation was only statistically significant in one experiment, but the trend was present in all four experiments that varied separation outside the crowding range. This might potentially be explained by the configural or group-based processing documented by @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020 and others, as grouping of distant elements is usually weaker than for nearby elements [e.g., @kubovyLawfulnessGroupingProximity1998].

## The mechanisms that cause spatial interference

As explained in the beginning of this chapter, one cause of short-range spatial interference is simply lack of spatial resolution by the processes that mediate tracking. If a process cannot distinguish between two locations, either because of a noisy representation of those locations or because the two locations are treated as one, then a target may often be lost when it comes too close to a distractor. This would be true of any imperfect mechanism, regardless of whether it is biological or man-made. The particular way that the human visual system is put together, however, may result in forms of spatial interference that do not occur in, for example, computer algorithms engineered for object tracking.

As described in \@ref(bottlenecks), our visual processing architecture has a pyramid-like structure, with processing at the retina being local and massively parallel, and then gradually converging such that neurons at higher stages have receptive fields responsive to large regions. At these higher stages processes critical to tasks like tracking or face recognition occur. Face-selective neurons, for example, are situated in temporal cortex and have very large receptive fields. For tracking, while the parietal cortex is thought to be more important than the temporal cortex, the neurons in these parietal areas again have large receptive fields.

A large receptive field is a problem when the task is to recognize an object in clutter or to track a moving target in the presence of nearby moving distractors. In the case of object recognition, without a mechanism to prevent processing of the other objects that share the receptive field, object recognition would have access to only a mishmash of the objects' features. Indeed, this indiscriminate combining of features is thought to be one reason for perceptual illusory conjunctions of features from different objects. Similarly, for object tracking, isolating the target is necessary to keep it distinguished from the distractors.

In principle, our visual systems might include attentional processes that when selecting a target can completely exclude distractors' visual signals from reaching the larger receptive fields. Actually implementing such a system using realistic biological mechanisms with our pyramid architecture, however, looks to be difficult [@tsotsosModelingVisualAttention1995]. Neural recordings reveal that while the signals from stimuli irrelevant to the current task are suppressed somewhat, they still have some effect on neural responses. The particular mechanism used by our visual system does appear to include active suppression of a region around a target, even if these effects are not large or spatially extensive enough to explain why we can only track a limited number of objects. The computer scientist John Tsotsos has long championed surround suppresssion as a practical way for high-level areas of the brain to isolate a stimulus in their large receptive fields. Such suppression likely involves descending connections from high-level areas and possibly recurrent processing [@tsotsosDifferentStagesVisual2008].

Note that on Tsotsos' account, it is only targets, not distractors, that have a region of suppression surrounding them. While the attempt of @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010 to attribute all of the cost of tracking additional targets to surround suppression among targets appears to have been misguided, in @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 we did find some tentative evidence supporting a greater range of interference in the two-target condition compared to the one-target condition. Again, the effect was small relative to the total additional-target performance cost. It appears that overlapping surround suppression associated with targets may impair tracking, but the spatial range of this does not extend much beyond the classic crowding range.

<!-- p.11:"the effect of separation was not significantly greater in the two- target condition than the one-target condition, but the difference did approach significance. Experiment 2: F(1, 7) 1⁄4 3.52, p=0.103. Experiment 3: F(1, 9) 1⁄4 3.89, p=0.054. Such an interaction would be consistent with the proposal that attending to an object results in an inhibitory surround, as attention to the two targets could then inhibit each other. This interaction is small, however, relative to the size of the additional-target cost (see Figure 7), suggesting that crowding is not responsible for much of the additional-target cost."
--> 

<!--While the @franconeriTrackingMultipleObjects2010 spatial interference theory is still frequently cited uncritically, the evidence against it seems to be strong.-->

Crowding, the impairment of object identification by nearby objects, has been studied more extensively than the spatial interference associated with object tracking. Like for tracking, however, the possibility of a suppression zone specific to targets remains understudied, as very few studies of crowding have varied the number of targets. I have found one study of the identification of briefly-presented stimuli which found that attending to additional gratings within the crowding range of a first grating resulted in greater impairment for identifying a letter [@mareschalAttentionalModulationCrowding2010]. This is consistent with the existence of surround suppression around each target. <!--Unfortunately, however, the study did not investigate how much further, if at all, spatial interference extended when there are more targets.--> 

<!--As reviewed by @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014, while dozens of MOT papers have manipulated spatial proximity, few have both required fixation and scaled separation with eccentricity such that the relationship of target load and the range of spatial interference could be directly assessed.-->

<!--@maki-marttunenDistinctNeuralMechanisms2019:"In both cohorts, increased load and close encounters (i.e., close spatial proximity) led to reduced accuracy in an additive manner. Load was associated with pupil dilations, whereas close encounters were not. Activity in dorsal attentional areas and frequency of saccades were proportionally larger both with higher levels of load and close encounters. Close encounters recruited additionally ventral attentional areas that may reflect orienting mechanisms. The activity in two brainstem nuclei, ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, showed clearly dissociated patterns. Our results constitute convergent evidence indicating that different mechanisms underlie processing challenges due to load and object spacing."-->

<!--Distractors that pass closer to targets can experience more inhibition (as measured by probes on objects; @doranRoleVisualAttention2010)-->

<!--MENTION THAT HOLCOMBECHEN FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR SPATIAL INTERFERENCE WITH 12 OBJECTS SHARING A CIRCULAR TRAJECTORY-->

As many MOT experiments involve targets and distractors coming very close to each other, spatial interference likely contributes to many of the errors in a typical MOT task. As we have seen in this chapter, that may be largely a data limitation - something that occurs regardless of the number of targets, as a result of the inherent ambiguity regarding which is a target and which is a distractor during close encounters for any system with limited spatial resolution; when objects are kept widely separated, it appears that spatial interference plays little to no role in tracking. <!--This may be mediated partly by surround suppression around targets, as well as the inherent ambiguity regarding which is a target and which is a distractor during close encounters for any system that has limited spatial resolution.--> 

Some other factor or factors is needed to explain the dramatic decline in tracking performance that can be found with more targets even in widely-spaced displays [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013].
<!--As will become clear in the next section, however, in such conditions, temporal interference can determine tracking performance. --> We can call that an "attentional resource", but that means basically nothing beyond that the tracking process is capacity-limited. We WANT TO GO FURTHER AND KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE TASK THAT

## Spatial selection of multiple locations

While multiple object tracking seems to require maintaining selection of moving objects, one can also ask about the capacity to maintain selection of stationary objects. If one cannot select the objects when they are stationary, perhaps one has no chance of tracking them when they are moving. Actually, the differing motion direction of moving objects may facilitate distinguishing among them, which will be discussed in section \@ref(beyondLocation), but nevertheless the processes that allow selection of multiple stationary objects are very likely part and parcel of those that support tracking.

Is selection of static objects resource-limited? @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 investigated this with two concentric circular arrays of stationary dots that were centered on fixation. Between one and eight of the dots were briefly highlighted, and then each dot was replaced by either a small horizontal or a small vertical bar. The participants' task was to search for a vertical bar, which was guaranteed to appear in the previously-cued locations. The participants were to press one key if a vertical bar was present among the cued locations, and another key if none of those locations contained a vertical bar.

In a sparse display with twelve locations, @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 found that average performance dropped from 98% when two locations were cued to 91% when six locations were cued. This decrease is fairly small, suggesting that if the result were to generalize to typical MOT displays, spatial selection processes would contribute only a small portion of the performance decrease with greater set sizes. However, MOT studies frequently allow objects to come much closer to each other than the spacing that @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 used in their sparse condition. In the denser conditions tested by @franconeriHowManyLocations2007, performance again started at a very high level for two cued locations, but dropped much more, to 74% correct or less for six cued locations.

It is difficult to know how these results can be translated into MOT tasks. The selection demands in a typical MOT task may be less taxing than in the @franconeriHowManyLocations2007 experiments, because participants need only maintain their attention on the objects, not search through them. However, it remains unclear how much less demanding that is, so we still do not know how much of the target-load effect in typical MOT displays can be attributed to failures of selection that would occur even were the objects to remain stationary.

In practice, people make many more errors in a tracking task if the targets move than if they do not move (CITATION NEEDED). This observation is not enough, however, to conclude that the limits on spatial selection are not the cause of most errors in moving-object tracking. One reason is that visual working memory can greatly benefit performance with static locations, but memory for locations likely does not update very well in the presence of motion, as will be discussed in section \@ref(identity).

# Unitary cognition (C = 1 processes) {#Cequals1}

Successful performance of a multiple object tracking task may be assisted by two resources. This worries me greatly.

One resource is what researchers *believe* they are studying. It can process multiple targets simultaneously, even if it processes them more poorly than it processes a lone target. This is what most researchers are interested in. However, the mind also has a resource that in some ways is more powerful.

The processes that support our ability to explicitly reason, referred to as System 1 in some contexts in cognitive psychology, can assist performance in many tasks. But they are very limited in capacity - some cognitive researchers think they can only operate on one thing at a time [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002]. This may be what prevents us from doing more than one 2-digit mental multiplication problem at a time. When applied to tracking, it means you can apply your powers of reasoning to tracking that target, for example to use what you've learned about object trajectories to predict future positions. I will refer to this as a C=1 process because its processing capacity may be only one object.

## An inconvenient possibility
 
<!---This reflects a unitary focus of attention that has an approximate capacity of only one.-->
A lot of the results trumpeted by tracking papers are rendered uninteresting because they could be due to our cognitive abilities operating on a single target, rather than the results speaking to the tracking resource that we can distribute to multiple targets. Many researchers that come out of the experimental psychology tradition content themselves with showing that a factor makes *some* difference to performance, p < 0.05. Never mind *how much* the factor matters. But in a task involving tracking several targets, a factor that has only a small effect could be explained by the unitary C=1 resource working on just one target. As an example of evidence that such processes may contribute to visual cognition, for a multi-colored shape, @xuCapacityVisualFeatures2015 found that participants could only mentally rotate a single part.

Let's say that a paper finds that people track multiple objects more accurately if they move on predictable trajectories than on unpredictable trajectories. I have to think that may simply be due to our central thought processes operating on just one target. Ruling this out requires sophisticated methods, such as showing that the predictable-trajectory advantage applies independently in each hemifield, as we will see in Chapter \@ref(twoBrains), or that the effect shows some other idiosyncrasy of tracking, such as inability to work with individual locations within a moving object, as described in Chapter \@ref(objects).

<!--(as opposed to psychophysics, which is more quantitative) -->
In case you are not entirely clear about my point, another way to put it is that by using our capacity for reasoning and symbol manipulation, we can perform a wide array of arbitrary tasks. We therefore should not be surprised by our ability to track a *single* target. We know that we have a visual system that makes the position and direction of motion of objects on our retina available to cognition, and that using our ability to think about where an object is going and deliberately move our attention to a future anticipated location, we might muddle through to success at tracking a single object.

Even when participants are asked to track several targets, then, one can expect that C=1 processes are contributing to overall performance, even if they are only involved in the processing of one of the targets. Thus, when researchers contrast tracking performance with different numbers of targets, one reason for the decline in performance may be that C=1 processes are, in each condition, processing only a single target, so performance declines in inverse proportion to the number of targets.

<!-- Unfortunately, researchers frequently neglect the fact that two sorts of mental abilities likely contribute to MOT performance: one or some limited in capacity to just a single target, and others with a greater processing capacity.  -->

# Objects and attentional spread {#objects}

In my rather cluttered living room, sunlight streaming through the window illuminates dozens of objects. Hugo, our family dog,  had been napping, but now stands up and ambles into the kitchen. As he moves, I track him with my attention. To do so, something in my brain has to identify as a single object a changing set of neurons, representing Hugo's different parts as they shuffle across my retina. How is this done?

It starts in the retina, but the processing that occurs there is far from enough to segment a dog, or almost any object, from my living room background. Processing in the thalamus and early visual cortex, at the very least, continues the job. Much, or perhaps all, of this early cortical processing occurs regardless of where one is attending — in other words, it is pre-attentive. Exactly how extensive this preattentive processing is, and what sorts of representations it results in, has been studied for years, but much is still not understood [@neisserDecisionTimeReactionTimeExperiments1963; @treismanVerbalCuesLanguage1964; @kimchiFiguregroundSegmentationCan2008].

Attentive tracking is typically conceptualized as a process wherein a limited resource simply selects one or more of the preattentively-created representations. It is unclear, however, whether processing is so neatly divided, with preattentive representations simply selected rather than attention participating in modifying or even creating the representation that is tracked. A popular view is that attending to a location results in binding some of the features there, such as color and orientation, but attention likely also contributes to figure-ground segregation, which is fundamental to defining an object [@petersonLowlevelHighlevelContributions2014]. As another intriguing possibility for the effect of attention, to explain the twinkle-goes illusion @nakayamaDynamicNoiseBackground2021 suggested that attentional tracking could cause the representation of a moving object to persist after the object has disappeared.

<!-- This selection process than allows for continuous monitoring of that entity's changing position as well as other sorts of events, such as detection of probes flashed on the associated stimulus. -->

Studying the relationship of tracking to preattentive processing can be difficult, but a relevant and straightforward issue is which sorts of stimuli can be tracked and which cannot. However, the initial deployment of attention likely occurs more via a spatial or featural index than through some sort of index of the objects in the scene. We cannot think "car" or "tree" to ourselves and expect our attention to immediately deploy to any cars or trees in the scene. In contrast, our ability to deploy attention to the cued, static *location* is well-established, which very rapidly facilitates perceptual performance for that location and neural activation in the associated parts of retinotopic cortices. We also have the ability to deploy attention directly to certain other features, such as color or motion direction  [@saenzGlobalFeaturebasedAttention2003; @whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011].

As a result of our featural selection capability, if a moving target differs from distractors in certain ways, then featural selection can be relied on to keep attention on the moving target. For example, if the targets are the only yellow objects in the scene, and all the distractors are blue or green, then one can think "yellow" and that is enough to keep attention on the targets and off the distractors (see also Chapter \@ref(identity)). It is when the targets are identical to the distractors, or not distinguishable from the distractors by one of the features that feature selection acts on, that a different process is needed to keep attention on a moving target.

When the targets and distractors are identical, spatial location selection may initiate the selection of a target, but if it were the only process operating, when an object moved, attention would be left behind. A striking characteristic of the experience of tracking is that the movement of attention along with an object often seems to take no more effort than attending to a static object. Indeed, one might say that attention seems to be positively pulled along - when the targets in an MOT trial begin to move, I have never had the experience of my attention staying behind, remaining at one of the original target locations. It feels unnatural to un-latch attention from a target and fix it to the target's current location while the target moves on. This is likely related to the ability of visual transients to attract attention - a moving object is essentially a rapid sequence of transients along a continuous array of locations.

The term "object-based attention" is sometimes bandied about as an explanation of why attention seems to automatically move along with a selected object, the idea being that the units of attentional selection are objects rather than locations [@pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006; @clarkLocationLocationLocation2009]. But no one seems to think that direct selection of objects is a thing, in the way that color selection is. That is, one cannot think "chair" and have all the locations of chairs in the scene become rapidly attended. Selection of chairs, or another object type, seems to require a search first, based on locations and simpler features. And even color selection may work via location, with thinking of a color resulting in availability of its locations, and attention then being deployed to those locations [@shihThereFeaturebasedAttentional1996].

## Stationary object selection

One notion that fits with these considerations is that attention is deployed first to a location or locations, but any object present can cause spatial attention to spread throughout that object. This "attentional spread" theory seems to be a popular one, in part due to the evidence from the paradigm I will describe next.

Dozens, possibly hundreds, of published papers have investigated the relationship of objects to attention using a cuing paradigm developed by @eglyShiftingVisualAttention1994.  @eglyShiftingVisualAttention1994 presented two static objects (rectangles) and presented a cue on one end of an object or another. They found that the cue resulted in a performance enhancement not only for probes at the location of the cue, but also at the cued object's other end. The comparison condition was performance at locations equidistant from the cue but not on the cued object. The findings reported in most of the many follow-up papers similarly find that participants are fastest and most accurate when the stimulus is presented in the same location as the cue, or on the same object but on a different part of that object. I used the qualifier "most" when referring to the follow-up papers because some papers did not find this [@davisReversalObjectBased2005; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionStrength2008; @shomsteinObjectbasedAttentionSensory2002; @louIndividualDifferencesTemporal2020], and a major concern is that there may be many more such null findings that ended up in the proverbial file drawer. Indeed, the effect sizes in the literature are often quite small and the studies not highly powered, which can be a red flag that publication bias may have created the illusion of a real effect [@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013].

Based on the pattern of sample sizes, effect sizes, and p-values in three dozen published object-based attention studies, @francisExcessSuccessArticles2022 argued that publication bias and/or p-hacking in the literature is rife. This is plausible in part because substantial proportions of researchers in psychology and other fields admit to such practices [@johnMeasuringPrevalenceQuestionable2012; @rabeloQuestionableResearchPractices2020; @chinQuestionableResearchPractices2021]. @francisExcessSuccessArticles2022 further point out that the only previously-published study with a large sample (120 participants) found a non-significant effect, of only a 6.5 ms response time advantage [@pilzHowPrevalentObjectBased2012], and in Francis et al.'s own study with 264 participants, the effect was also quite small, at 14 ms. For an effect of this size, Francis et al. calculated that the sample sizes typically used in the published literature were unlikely to yield statistical significance without some help from p-hacking or another questionable research practice. As a result, many papers in the literature make conclusions about objects and attention based on results that unfortunately cannot be trusted.

Publication bias and p-hacking are less of an issue when the effects being studied are large, because in those cases studies are more likely to be adequately powered, resulting in fewer false positives and false negatives. Some effects are so large that spending a period of seconds looking at a display is enough to convince oneself that an effect is real. Fortunately, those large effects include some that relate to how variation in objects affects tracking, as we will see in the next section.

## The end of the line

Many objects, such as the letter 'T', have salient parts. While normally we think of 'T' as a single object, we can also see that it is made up of a horizontal segment and a vertical segment. In conscious awareness, then, we have access to both the whole object level and to an individual parts level. You are able to focus attention on individual bits of the vertical segment, even though there are no visual characteristics that differentiate it. But what kind of representation(s) does our object tracking processes operate on?

In early visual cortex, different populations of neurons respond to the the horizontal and to the vertical stroke of a 'T'. But having neurons that respond to a thing does not suffice to be able to track that thing, as tracking operates on only some sorts of representations. @schollWhatVisualObject2001 shed light on this by asking participants to try to track the ends of lines. The notion that one end of an undifferentiated shape (such as a line) is an object is somewhat unnatural, but it can be useful. When paying attention to someone holding a rifle, for example, it may be important to continuously monitor the location of the front of its barrel.

Four moving lines were presented in the @schollWhatVisualObject2001 study, with one end of each line designated as a target. At the end of the trial, the lines stopped moving and participants were to click with a mouse on the line ends that were targets. During a trial, each line grew, shrank, and rotated as each of its ends wandered about the screen randomly.

![A schematic of the display used by Scholl et al. (2001)](imagesForRmd/linesSchollPylyshynFeldman_madeByHolcombe.png){width=40%}

The results were striking. Performance on the task was abysmal relative to a control condition in which the two ends of the line were not connected. Simply by viewing an example trial, one very quickly gets a sense of how difficult the task is - the effect is very large.


```{r lines, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Using this display, Scholl et al. (2001) asked participants to track the end of each of several lines."}

```

The task of tracking line ends in the @schollWhatVisualObject2001 experiment was complicated by the fact that the objects frequently crossed over each other, and also their length changed over time. But @howeCanAttentionBe2012 showed that these complications were not the main reason for the poor performance. It simply is the case, it seems, that one cannot confine one's tracking processes to one bit of an undifferentiated object. This inability to track the ends of lines fits in with the view this chapter opened with, that preattentive processes define objects that become what tracking operates on.

Maintaining attention on a part of the visual scene in the absence of anything in the image to delineate that part *feels like* it requires concentration, as if we must continually think about what we are supposed to be attending to. If lots of cognitive resources are needed to maintain the "object" representation when it is not provided by preattentive processes, then for such objects may only be able to track one. This idea of C = 1 (capacity of one) processes being involved or required for some forms of tracking was introduced in Chapter \@ref(whichAspects). 

## Object creation and object tracking: Distinct processes?

Researchers usually make a strong distinction between the processing that determines *how many* objects one can track and those that determine *what kinds* of objects can be tracked. An assumption of separate processing stages is popular in the study of visual cognition generally. Visual search, for example, is usually conceptualized this way [@wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997; @nakayamaVisualSurfaceRepresentation1995], and appears to be an implicit assumption in two reviews of objects and tracking  [@schollObjectsAttentionState2001; @pylyshynSeeingVisualizingIt2006]. <!-- No interaction between number of objects to track and what kinds of objects can be tracked.--> It would be convenient if object creation and object tracking occurred at distinct processing stages, as that is more straightforward to study than an interactive system [@simonSciencesArtificialReissue1969; @sternbergDiscoveryProcessingStages1969].

```{r simpleArchitecture, echo=FALSE, out.width="55%", fig.cap="A schematic of the idea that objects are created prior to the action of tracking processes, which then point to the already-formed object representations but do not change them."}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/flowDiagrams/objectCreationTrackingSeparateDiagram.png")
```

In accord with the above diagram, there certainly is evidence that tracking is high-level, for example @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021 found evidence that tracking operates on perceived object position rather than more low-level representation of position. Nevertheless, attention and object creation may be interactive. For example, the way stimulus elements are organized by attention can determine what illusory contours are created and perceived, as well as the lightness and depth that is perceived [@harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019; @harrisonAttentionalSelectionIllusory2019; @peterVoluntaryAttentionModulates2005].  Our ability to perceive the complex motion of a human body from only several points of light highlights that object perception can involve hierarchical motion segmentation that reflects an interaction between Gestalt grouping and top-down knowledge of the overall shape of objects and the relative motion pattern of their parts [@johanssonVisualPerceptionBiological1973; @wangSearchingLifeMotion2010] (see the grouping Chapter (\@ref(grouping))).

Using a paradigm based on the attentional spread literature reviewed above, @ongchocoHowCreateObjects2019 asked participants to practice "imagining" a shape in a uniform grid of lines until they felt they could actually see the shape, which happened fairly readily. The detection of flashed probes was enhanced for those presented on the same imagined object, compared with equidistant ones presented on different objects. In summary, a variety of evidence suggests a role for neural feedback in object segmentation, with some role for attention, but the extent of its importance remains unclear [@papaleInfluenceObjecthoodRepresentation2021; @wyatteEarlyRecurrentFeedback2014; @harrisonVoluntaryControlIllusory2019]. 
 
Potentially, the same attentional resources that mediate tracking may also contribute to the creation of object representations. One consequence would be a trade-off between the involvement of attention in constructing object representations and the number of objects that can be tracked. Informal experience with tracking the line ends in the @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 display seems to support this. If when you watch the movie of \@ref(fig:lines), you concern yourself with keeping track of the end of only *one* object, you are likely to succeed. But recall that it is difficult or impossible to accurately track *four* object ends - indeed, @schollObjectsAttentionState2001 found that participants' performance was approximately that predicted if they could track one line end, but not more.

Possibly the ability to track only one line end is a result of consuming all of one's tracking resources to *create* a representation of the end of the line as like a single object. An important alternative, however, is that tracking the end of a line has uses a C=1 process rather than the tracking processes that allow us to track more objects in most circumstances. This would mean that covert tracking of multiple objects is qualitatively different from covert tracking of a single object. Because the participants in the @ongchocoHowCreateObjects2019 study imagined only a single object, it is possible that their results reflect a C=1 process rather than the processes we use to track multiple objects, like the mental rotation study of @xuCapacityVisualFeatures2015.
 
## What tracking sticks to

Even when all of our cognitive resources are brought to bear on a single entity, some kinds of entities still can't be tracked. @anstisEyesPursueMoving2010 asked participants to track the intersection of two shapes moving in a configuration that elicits the "chopsticks illusion" @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990. A horizontal and vertical line slide over each other in the chopsticks illusion, with each line following a clockwise circular trajectory. Viewers perceive the intersection of the two lines to also be moving clockwise (demo [here](http://anstislab.ucsd.edu/illusions/chopsticks-illusion/)), but in fact the intersection moves counterclockwise only. This error may be, in part, a failure of object tracking because if participants had been able to attentionally track the intersection, they should have been able to judge its trajectory.  @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 also found that participants could not accurately pursue the intersection with their eyes.

The true counterclockwise trajectory of the intersection becomes obvious perceptually if one views the display through a window so that the ends of the lines are occluded rather than visible, and in that condition participants were able to smooth pursue the intersection accurately, in a clockwise direction. So the problem is a likely pre-attentive interpretation of the motion that we cannot overcome. @anstisImperceptibleIntersectionsChopstick1990 suggested that the reason that the intersection is  perceived to move in the wrong direction ordinarily is because the clockwise motion of the ends of the lines is mistakenly assigned to the intersection, similar to how the motion of the ends of lines can veto the barber-pole illusion. The illusion is an example of a failure to track a rather simply-defined point. Evidently, tracking cannot operate on that point, possibly because before the operation of tracking, a particular interpretation of motion and form is created. As schematized by the figure above, some processing of motion and form appears to occur prior to the operation of tracking. <!--As we will see, however, there is also reason to believe that attention can mold some object representations.-->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Some stimuli used by Howe et al. (2012). CC-BY"}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/PiersHowe/PiersHoweStimuli.png")
```

As we saw in the "The ends of the line" section above, maintaining the representation of an undifferentiated part of an object is not something that our multiple object tracking resources are capable of. What sort of differentiation is needed? @schollWhatVisualObject2001 varied how distinct the end of an object was. In a "dumbbell" condition, the object used were  two squares connected by a line. In that condition, participants' accuracy was lower than a standard separated squares condition, but not statistically significantly so - any detriment to tracking appeared to be small, suggesting that participants are able to track a dumbbell end. However, @howeCanAttentionBe2012 tested a dumbbell condition that was rather similar to that of @schollWhatVisualObject2001, but they found performance was substantially lower than when the objects (discs in their case) were not connected. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, and it appears it could reflect the noisiness of the data of the two studies. @howeCanAttentionBe2012 also tested a "luminance" condition, pictured above, and found that performance (80% correct) was substantially lower than their baseline condition (96% correct), although not as low as for undifferentiated bar ends (72% correct). They were surprised that the clear difference in luminance between the targets and the connector in the luminance condition was not enough to keep tracking from being so adversely affected by the connectors.

These results suggest that multiple object tracking uses a different segmentation of objects than what is available to us when we focus our attention on a single object. The findings have some similarity to those found in conjunction visual search studies. @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997 asked participants to search for conjunctions of features, such as red and vertical. If the vertical red part of an object were physically connected to a horizontal and green part, then participants were much slower to find the red vertical target segment in the display, among the green vertical and red horizontal distractors. In other words, it seemed that physically connecting one feature to another lumped it together as an undifferentiated collection of features from the perspective of search processes, what @wolfePreattentiveObjectFiles1997 termed a "preattentive object file". No researcher seems to have tested displays of this nature for both tracking and search <!--FUTURE-->, but for now the parsimonious account has to be that multiple object tracking and search operate on the same object representations.

## Growth, shrinkage, and tracking

Some objects and substances change shape.  When one opens a faucet in a kitchen, for example, a jet of water shoots into the sink, and flattens on the sink's bottom as it expandings into a puddle. As one pours beer into a glass, a froth forms, which gradually thickens as the top of the liquid rises. These are examples of non-rigid motion, specifically substances that change shape as they move.

To investigate tracking of non-rigid substances, @vanmarleAttentiveTrackingObjects2003 devised an object that moved a bit like an inchworm or a slinky. In a condition I'll refer to as the "slinky" condition, each object began as a square. It would then move by extending its leading edge until it had the shape of a long and thin rectangle. Subsequently, the trailing edge of the slinky, which was still at its original location, would move forward until the slinky was a square again, now entirely at a new location. @vanmarleAttentiveTrackingObjects2003 found that slinky tracking performance was very poor. <!--the substances condition difficulty seems to be accounted for by this problem-->

What is it about tracking that causes such difficulty with slinkys? @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 tested a number of conditions that seemed to rule out possibilities such as the faster speed of the slinky's edges relative to the control conditions. @schollWhatHaveWe2008 suggested that the reason the slinky was difficult to track was, as they put it, "there was no unambiguous location for attention to select on this shrinking and growing extended object" because "each object’s location could no longer be characterized by a single point" (p.63). There may be something to this, but it is not entirely clear what is meant by an object's location not being characterizable by a single point. The objects typically used for MOT, discs with no internal features, also have no unambiguous internal locations, because their insides are a completely undifferentiated mass. If one wishes to refer to a single point for their location, their centroid could be used, but this seems just as true for an object changing in size and shape. Additionally, in the chopsticks illusion reviewed above, the target was defined by a single point (the intersection of two lines), yet it could not be tracked.

While the reason or reasons that tracking a slinky is difficult remains obscure, it seems that object expansion and contraction disrupt both tracking and localization. After @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 replicated the tracking findings of @schollWhatHaveWe2008, they probed the effect of size changes on localization. Participants were presented with a rectangle for 200 ms at a random location on the screen, and were asked to click on the location of the center of the rectangle. In a baseline condition, the rectangle did not change in size, shape, or location during its 200 ms presentation. In the size-change condition, the length of the object increased due to expansion for half of the interval and shrank due to contraction during the other half. Participants' localization errors were about 14% larger in this changing-size condition. This appeared to be driven by errors along the axis of the object's expansion and contraction, as errors in the orthogonal direction were not significantly different from the baseline condition. <!--FUTURE: Do a continuous mouse-tracking study of this to assess the lag and sources of noise with richer data. -->

The substantial localization impairment documented by @howeVisuallyTrackingLocalizing2013 may possibly be the cause of the poor  performance during MOT. However, that is still not clear. An important next step is to measure localization errors when the task is to monitor multiple objects changing in size rather than just one. If the localization deficit caused by change in size worsens with object load, this would help implicate the processes underlying tracking <!--FUTURE. Could do a continuous mouse-tracking version-->.

## Could tracking work by attentional spreading?

The relationship between object representations and tracking schematized in Figure \@ref(fig:simpleArchitecture) suggests that attention selects *entire* object representations. It has been suggested, however, that the process instead begins with selection of a particular location, which then spreads up to the edges of the object. A gradual growth of the area of attentional activation to encompass an entire object has been observed neurophysiologically in certain tasks [e.g., @wannigAutomaticSpreadAttentional2011].

Although I have not seen anyone discuss this possibility, the spreading of attention may actually contribute to the ability to track moving objects. When an object moves, its leading edge will occupy new territory while its trailing edge continues to occupy an old location. If spreading of attention up to object boundaries continually occurs, then attention should spread to the new locations near the leading edge. In such a fashion, attention could, by continually expanding to the new location of a leading edge and contracting with a trailing edge, stay on a moving object. Spreading of activation has been documented neurophysiologically in V1 of rhesus macaques given the task of evaluating whether two points are on the same curved line segment [@roelfsemaObjectbasedAttentionPrimary1998].

Presenting probes during a task of tracking multiple lines, @alvarezHowDoesAttention2005 found that probes presented at the center of objects were detected much more accurately than end probes, suggesting that attentional resources were concentrated on the centers of the lines. The spreading account seems to instead predict that accuracy would be highest near the trailing end of an object. It appears, however, that the researchers did not analyze the data to check whether of the two object ends, accuracy was higher for probes at the trailing end. Clearly, much more work <!--FUTURE--> is needed to reveal the nature of attentional spread while an object moves and any role that has in facilitating tracking.
<!-- Point objects, stepping objects (works for 1 target and probably for multiple ones if they are stepping a short distance, but I know of NO studies of MOT with apparent motion FUTURE), and the finding that attention tends to be ahead of an object? I don't recall whether that's been done --> 
<!-- Reminescent of how rapid eye movements (saccades) tend to go to the centroids of objects.-->

<!--Many questions remain regarding what sorts of objects attention gloms onto.


This proposition, that there are actually two resources that can assist tracking, one with much more limited capacity (perhaps for just one object) and the other with fewer capabilities but higher capacity, is an intriguing one but not-->

# Grouping {#grouping}

Carving the scene into objects is not the only segmentation task conducted by our visual systems. We also perceive groups, as defined by a variety of cues. Can tracking follow entire groupings of unconnected objects? @alzahabiEnsemblePerceptionMultipleobject2021 used clusters of discs as targets and as distractors. These clusters maintained a constant spatial arrangement as they wandered about the display. Participants seemed to do well at tracking these clusters. However, these researchers did not rule out the possibility that participants were tracking just one disc of each cluster, and I am not aware of any work providing strong evidence that a tracking focus can track an entire group.

@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesized that in MOT experiments, participants track an imaginary shape formed by the targets, specifically a polygon whose vertices are the target positions. Progress has been slow in understanding whether all participants do this or just a minority do, and in what circumstances. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 found a result that they took as evidence that some participants track a shape defined by the targets while others do not. In their task, at the end of the trial when the targets and distractors stopped moving, four of the objects were highlighted and the task was to press one button if all four were targets (match), and to press a different button otherwise (non-match). Error rates were lowest when none of the objects highlighted were targets, and errors were progressively more common as the number of highlighted objects that were targets increased. This was unsurprising. For trials where all four of the highlighted objects were targets (match), however, error rates were much lower than when only three were targets (a non-match). @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 suggested that this reflected a "perceptual strategy of monitoring the global shape configuration of the tracked target items." They went on to split the participants based on whether they had a relatively low error rate in the match condition, investigated the neural correlates of that, and made various conclusions about the neural processing that underlies virtual shape tracking.

The inferences of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 are based on the split of participants based on low error rate in the match condition compared to the condition where none of the highlighted objects match. The idea seems to be that if participants weren't using a shape tracking strategy, error rates would steadily increase from the trials where none of the highlighted objects were targets to the trials where all of the objects highlighted were targets. However, there are other possible reasons for this pattern of results. One aspect of the @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 experiment is that one of the two response choices (non-match) was the correct answer in 80% of trials. Because participants were not told that, some of them surely expected that they should press the two buttons approximately equally often. By pressing the "match" button more often (close to 50% of trials) than the appropriate 20% of trials, they would artificially have the relatively low error rate for the full-match condition that was observed. @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 mention the possibility of a response bias but suggest that this would result in the opposite (a high error rate) to what I have suggested. The problem seems to be that they didn't consider that the participants may have expected the match stimulus to occur more often than it did.

A response bias is not the only alternative to the virtual grouping account of @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014. The low error rate in the full-match condition might also occur for other reasons. Imagine that a participant tracked only one target and checked that target at the end of each trial for whether it was highlighted. If that one target is not highlighted, the participant presses the non-match button, otherwise they press the match button. For such a participant, the chance of getting the answer wrong when none of the probed objects are targets is zero. It is higher when one of the probed objects is a target (25% if the participant tracks one target perfectly on every trial and makes no finger errors), and still higher when two or three probed objects is a target. When three probed objects are targets, in three out of four cases, one of them is the target the participant tracked, so the participant frequently gets it wrong. But when all four of the probed objects are targets, the participant will always respond correctly. Thus, a low error rate in this all-targets-probed condition that is very close to the error rate in the no-targets-probed condition can be a sign of a participant who only monitors one target. But @merkelSpatiotemporalPatternsBrain2014 interpreted this result as instead meaning that the participant was tracking a virtual shape formed by all four of the targets.

<!--This doesn't address their correlation argument. Correlation predictions. Simplest version of my account is that only lapse rate differs between participants. High lapse rate contributes most to M0 and M4 variance, so if lapse rate is driving individual differences, correlation between M4 and M0 should be higher than M4 with other conditions, which it is. But for M1 and M2 I'm not sure why correlations so high.

Does Pearson correlations not affected by base rate for an error rate variable? I think not, so if there is a floor effect for M4, it should have a smaller correlation with everything else. But actually M0- has the lowest error rate and it has higher correlations.

What if you track three targets? Decision rule: if all three match, say yes, otherwise no. Then in M4 you will get 0% error rate again. With M3, 25%? error rate, then smaller for M2, M1, M0.  

Why would you ever say 'no' in M4? It would have to be because you ended up tracking the wrong target(s). But if you know you sometimes end up tracking a wrong target(s), if 3 of your 4 targets match 3 of those highlighted, then maybe your decision rule is to say 'yes'. So then sometimes you get M4 wrong. And in M3, you could get even more wrong, because you are happy with just 3 being the same. In M2, you might get less wrong.

Participants could differ in A) lapse rate; B) number tracked; C) decision rule.
They claim that half of participants have a big difference . But these might be the non-holistic participants. If I track holistically, with some noise in my virtual polygon representation I get M4 most correct? I get M3 most wrong, M2 less wrong, M1 even less, and M0 all correct.

-->


<!--Imagine you just check one target on every trial for whether it is highlighted. Chance of getting it wrong is zero at M0 ,progressively higher for M1, M2, and M3. But then at M4, should go back to zero. So this effect is unsurprising. And if you select people with low error rates for M4, you might be grabbing people who only tracked one target. But Merkel probably think they're grabbing people who tracked holistically.

They correlated M4 with everything else, and those correlations were lower than M1 with M2, M2 with M3, etc. Whereas all participants responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the match-0 trials, about half of the participants also responded rapidly and with a low error rate on the full-match trials. These latter participants also tended to make more errors on match-3 trials than did the other half of the participants.
-->


## Hierarchical relations 

In the real world, the movement in a scene relative to our retinas is rarely as independent as the movement of the objects in a typical multiple object tracking experiment. Often there is a strong motion element throughout the visual field created by the movement of the observer, and recovering true object movement likely requires detecting deviations from that [@warrenPerceptionObjectTrajectory2007]. Even when the observer and their eyes do not move, hierarchical motion relationships are common. When one views a tree on a windy day, the largest branches sway slowly, while the smaller limbs attached to the larger branches move with the larger branches but also, being more flexible and lighter, have their own, more rapid motion.

These aspects of the structure of the visual world may be one reason that our visual systems are tuned to relative motion [@tadinWhatConstitutesEfficient2002; @maruyaRapidEncodingRelationships2013]. When we see a wheel roll by, we experience individual features on the wheel as moving forward, reflecting the global frame of the entire wheel, but also as moving in a circle, reflecting the motion relative to the center of the wheel.

This decomposition of a wheel rim's movement is so strong that people systematically mis-report the trajectory of the points on the wheel [@proffittUnderstandingWheelDynamics1990]. The red curve in the animation below reveals that a point on a rolling wheel traces out a curve that involves up, down, and forward motion, but no backward motion. The trajectory reported by participants is very different and tends to include a period of backward motion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="The red curve is that traced out by a point on a rolling wheel, by Zorgit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cycloid_f.gif"}  
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("movies/cycloid/Cycloid_f_static.png")
```

@billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020 varied the structured motion pattern of the moving discs of an MOT task to show that hierarchical relations are extracted and used to facilitate tracking. This should be studied further. For example, the attentional demands, if any, of such hierarchical motion decomposition has not been explored much. Thus it remains unclear to what extent the hierarchical relations are calculated by the application of tracking or other attentional resources, versus tracking operating on a representation of hierarchical relations that was determined pre-attentively.

<!-- Mention the bendy-pencil illusion https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193187 maybe.  "the illusory bending motion may be due to an inability of observers to accurately track the motions of features whose image displacements undergo rapid simultaneous changes in both space and time" -->

## Eyes to the center

The human visual system represents scenes as more than just a collection of objects. It performs a rapid global analysis of visual scenes, giving us summary information sometimes referred to as "ensemble statistics" [@alvarezSpatialEnsembleStatistics2009]. One such ensemble statistic is the location of the center or centroid of the objects. This is useful for eye movement planning, among other things — to monitor a group of objects, it is helpful to look at the center of the group, as that can minimize how far into peripheral vision the objects are situated. 

@zelinskyEyeMovementAnalysis2008 and @fehdEyeMovementsMultiple2008 independently reported that during multiple object tracking, the eyes of many participants frequently are directed at blank locations near the center of the array of targets, in addition to participants sometimes gazing directly at targets. This finding has been replicated by subsequent work [@hyonaEyeBehaviorMultiple2019]. The nature of the central point that participants tend to look at is not entirely clear. Researchers have suggested that it may be the average of the targets' locations, or the average location of all the moving objects (both targets and distractors). Another possibility that has been investigated is that participants tend to look at the centroid of the shape formed by the targets, which recalls the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that what is tracked is the shape defined by the targets. @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 introduced the idea of an "anti-crowding point", which minimizes the ratio between each target's distance from the gaze point and distance from every distractor. The idea was that participants move their gaze closer to a target when it is near a distractor to avoid confusing targets with distractors. Note, however, that the Lukavsky metric does not take into account the limited range of the empirical crowding zone, which is about half the eccentricity of an object.

In a comparison of all these metrics against the eyetracking data, @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 found that the anti-crowding point best predicted participants' gaze in his experiment, followed by the average of the target locations. These points both matched the data better than the centroid of the targets. This undermines the @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992 hypothesis that a virtual polygon is tracked, and the finding of best performance for the anti-crowding point is consistent with other results that participants tend to look closer at targets that are near other objects 
[@vaterDisentanglingVisionAttention2017; @zelinskyRoleRescueSaccades2010].

More work must be done to understand the possible role of the anti-crowding eye movement strategy suggested by @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013. Spatial interference does not seem to extend further than half an object's eccentricity, in both static identification tasks [@pelliUncrowdedWindowObject2008' @gurnseyCrowdingSizeEccentricity2011] and multiple object tracking [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014], but the anti-crowding point devised by @lukavskyEyeMovementsRepeated2013 does not incorporate such findings. Its performance could be compared to a measure that is similar but excludes from the calculation distractors further than about half an object's eccentricity.

# Two brains or one? {#twoBrains}

A human brain has two halves, a left and a right, that are anatomically connected, but there are fewer cross-hemisphere connections than there are within-hemisphere connections. 
<!--While an industry of education consultants and "brain training" companies exploits  common left brain, right brain misconceptions,  
We all have a "left brain" and a "right brain", which have different learning styles, and they should be trained both separately and in a way that gets them communicating with each other. Or so many would have you believe. The anatomical division of the hemispheres has been hyped into a supposed plethora of implications for behavior and learning. A veritable industry of education consultants and "brain training" providers have peddled these ideas, selling programs they refer to as, for example, "left brain versus right brain" training [@kroezeBrainGymPseudoscientific2016].--> Much of sensory and perceptual processing runs rather independently in the two halves of the cortex, but more cognitive functions such as declarative memory benefit from a very tight integration. This integration is extensive enough that the comparison of our two hemispheres to our two hands or our two legs is misleading.

Our conscious experience, too, is quite unified. We experience no discontinuity when the movement of our eyes, or of an object, cause an object to shift from one hemifield, where it is processed predominantly by one hemisphere, to the other hemifield. Communication between the two hemispheres happens rapidly and continuously. Despite the claims of salespeople who prey on well-meaning schools and parents, there is no good evidence that exercises designed to insure both hemispheres process stimuli have any benefit for learning. 

In "split-brain" patients, many of the connections between the hemispheres have been lost. Yet such patients can still perform tasks such as visual search in both hemifields, suggesting that both hemispheres have the mechanisms needed to do such tasks. When split-brain patients are asked to search for a target among many distractor objects, spreading the load by distributing the distractors across the two hemifields can yield a large benefit, suggesting that the two hemispheres in these patients carry out their searches independently [@luckIndependentAttentionalScanning1994]. For intact individuals, no such advantage is seen, suggesting that in a normal brain, the processes that evaluate each stimulus for whether it is the target are integrated across the hemispheres into a single attentional focus [@luckIndependentHemisphericAttentional1989].

Although the hemispheres show tight integration during many tasks, each hemisphere does specialize in certain functions. The left hemisphere has greater competence in language functions such as reading, while the right hemisphere is better at recognizing faces. One behavioral consequence is that response times for a face recognition task are slightly faster when the stimulus is presented wholly in the left hemifield (to the right hemisphere) than when it is presented wholly in the right hemifield, whereas the opposite is found for word reading [@rizzolattiOppositeSuperioritiesRight1971]. With extended time to process a stimulus, however, such behavioral asymmetries can disappear, because eventually the information from one hemisphere gets communicated to the other.

From the performance of most perceptual and attentional tasks, then, in typically-developing humans there is little overt sign that the brain is divided into two halves. Multiple object tracking, however, is a major exception to this. The pattern of performance found indicates that the limited resource that determines how many objects one can keep track of resides largely with a process that operates independently in the two hemispheres.

In 2005, George Alvarez & Patrick Cavanagh reported a stunning finding from their MOT task. Using objects that resembled spinning pinwheels, as a target they designated an individual bar of a pinwheel. Performance in a two-target condition (the targets were one bar of each of two different pinwheels) was contrasted with that for a one-target condition [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005]. When the second target was positioned in the same hemifield as the first target, accuracy in the two-target condition was much worse (89% vs. 63%). Remarkably, however, when the second target belonged to a pinwheel located in the opposite hemifield, there was very little performance decrement - accuracy was 93% in the one-target condition, and 90% correct in the two-target condition. This suggests that the processes that limit successful tracking in this task are largely specific to each hemifield. 

It was already known that sensory processing and quite a lot of perceptual processing occurs independently in each hemisphere. What is somewhat surprising is that a higher-level, limited-capacity process would be hemisphere-independent. Such capacities were traditionally thought to be among the processes that are tightly integrated across the two hemispheres, forming a single resource "pool", not two independent limits. We will get back to this point, first we'll examine more extensively the evidence for hemispheric independence of object tracking.

The hemispheric independence of a task can be quantified. Imagine that adding a second stimulus to a hemifield reduces performance by 20 percentage points, but adding that stimulus to the other hemifield reduces performance by only 5 percentage points. One can quantify the hemispheric independence, then, as (20-5) / 20 = 75% hemifield independence. Ideally, however, one would not use raw accuracy but instead would correct for the accuracy one can achieve by guessing. When [applying such a calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd) to the @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 results, the estimated level of independence is very high: `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE1Independence)`% independence in one of their experiments, and `r round(100*alvarezCavanaghE3Independence)`% in the other. 

@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 themselves, like other researchers who have investigated this question, did not do these calculations. @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 calculated expected performance if the hemifields are in fact completely independent, and reported that performance was not statistically significantly worse than that figure. They then suggested that there was complete independence, but this is based on the common fallacy of concluding a null hypothesis is true when the evidence does not reject it at a p<.05 level [@aczelQuantifyingSupportNull2018]. That is, for the null hypothesis they inappropriately started with their conclusion (complete independence), and then affirmed this conclusion on the basis of not finding much evidence against it. Nevertheless, their data do suggest hemispheric independence of approximately 90%. In a study with similar methods, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 found `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence (they did not calculate a number, so this is [my calculation](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)).

Some of the follow-up studies in this area have not included enough conditions to quantify the degree of independence, or confounded distribution of the targets to two hemifields with greater distance among them, such that any benefit might have been due to less spatial crowding interference, a phenomenon discussed in Chapter \@ref(spatialInterference).

@holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @chenResourceDemandsObject2013 also found evidence for a high degree of independence, using a slightly different approach based on speed thresholds. The findings were compatible with approximately 100% hemifield independence or a bit less. @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010<!--Figure 1--> and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 also found evidence for a substantial bilateral advantage compared to adding a target in the same hemifield. 

These findings of hemispheric independence have not replicated in all circumstances [e.g., @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008] <!--performance in all the conditions involved in their comparison were greater than 85% correct, including many low speeds where performance was near ceiling -->  <!--For most of these tasks, but not @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010, more targets was confounded with having to make more responses and remember said responses at the end of the trial, so some of the residual cost could be due to that being unitary rather than hemifield-specific.-->, but the successful replications strongly suggest that at least in some circumstances, tracking does occur mostly independently in the two hemispheres. I say "mostly independently" rather than suggesting complete independence because each individual study has too much statistical uncertainty to rule out a figure such as 75% independence, even when the point estimates I've reported above suggest a higher degree of independence.

@shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 suggested that the reason they did not find evidence for hemifield independence is that they used only two targets, whereas according to them the original @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 report of hemifield independence used four targets. This is unlikely to be the reason for the discrepancy, however, because in their E1 and E2 @alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005 did find evidence for hemifield independence using just two targets, as did @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012 and @stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014. The @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 data may have been afflicted by a ceiling effect, as accuracy was over 85% correct in all conditions in their experiment.

<!-- Shim, Alvarez, & Jiang (2008) found no advantage for targets in different hemifields. Why? Not sure, but the objects weren’t spaced far enough part to not crowd each other across the hemifield boundaries. In contrast, Shim et al. and Bello et al. suggest it was because hemifield limit doesn’t apply when just two targets. Holcombe & Chen found it did, but Bello suggests the reason is that we used circular trajectories that are somehow different, they say you can extrapolate more with them, whereas it may be that you can extrapolate less.   The target-target distance effect in Shim et al. is huge! How do I explain that? One possible explanation is Carlson’s quadrantic deficit.-->

A limitation of deriving hemispheric independence from accuracy is that they depend on the assumption that if a person can only track one target, in a condition where the person is also trying to track a second target, the person will succeed just as often in tracking one of the two. My introspective experience, however, indicates that in some circumstances, trying to track both targets causes one  to fail at both, and thus one is better off only trying to track one. The reason for this may be that a particular threshold amount of resource is needed to track a target, and so if neither target is allocated that much resource, tracking will fail for both. Evidence for this was provided by @chenResourceDemandsObject2013. In the terminology  of the @normanDatalimitedResourcelimitedProcesses1975 framework introduced in Chapter \@ref(whichAspects), the resource function that relates attentional resource proportion to accuracy falls below a straight line. This means that quantitative estimates of hemispheric independence will be overestimates, particularly in circumstances where the participants do not realize they may be better off focusing their efforts on tracking fewer targets than the number they have been told to track <!--FUTURE-->.

@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007 found evidence not only for hemifield independence but also quadrant-level independence, which they attributed to the partial separation of the retinotopic quadrant representations in areas V2 and V3. Using different stimuli, @shimSpatialSeparationTargets2008 and @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 did not, however, find evidence for quadrantic independence. Specifically, they did not find evidence for a deficit when two targets were positioned in the same quadrant compared to different quadrants but in the same hemifield. More work on this topic should be done.

## Some tracking resources are NOT hemifield-specific

One attentional process that is *not* hemifield-specific is feature attention, for example attention to color. When a participant is told to look for a red target, they are able to use feature attention to enhance all red objects, no matter where they are in the visual field [@whiteFeaturebasedAttentionInvoluntarily2011]. The decision to look for red originates with cognitive processes and remains hemifield-unified rather than hemifield-specific at the level of visual cortex [@saenzGlobalEffectsFeaturebased2002]. Indeed, people seem to be unable to confine the enhancement of red objects to one hemifield [@loHowWeSelect2014]. In real-world tracking where objects are at least somewhat heterogeneous and thus targets often have a different average color and other features than distractors, feature attention will facilitate tracking, and this facilitation is not hemifield-specific.

A previous Chapter (\@ref(Cequals1)) introduced the idea of C=1 cognitive processes that can support tracking of a single target but perhaps not multiple targets. Such processing likely is not hemisphere-specific, being aligned with "central executive" processes that integrate processing in both hemispheres. <!--We easily attend to objects in any part of the visual field, left or right.-->

@chenResourceDemandsObject2013 found evidence for both hemifield-specific tracking processes and processes not specific to a hemifield, operating in the same MOT task. Two targets were used, and on some trials they moved at different speeds. When a slow-moving target was paired (presented in the same trial) with a speedier target, accuracy was lower for the slow-moving target than if it was paired with a target that was slower. This suggests that participants allocate more tracking resources to the faster of two targets, presumably because slower targets do not require much resource to track well. This trade-off was most pronounced when the two targets were in the same hemifield, but seemed to occur to some degree even when the two targets were in different hemifields, implicating a cross-hemifield resource that plays a small role. This cross-hemifield resource may be a C=1 process. Furthermore, as discussed in the next section, perturbing one parietal lobe can affect performance in both hemifields, which suggests that each hemisphere can in some circumstances mediate tracking in either hemifield.

## The underlying mechanisms

The evidence reviewed above for hemifield independence suggests that hemisphere-specific processes determine how many targets one can track. This raises the question of what sort of processes those are, and how they interact with the cognitive processes that are more integrated across the hemispheres.

Steve Franconeri and colleagues have championed the idea that the hemisphere independence stems from spatial interference processes, by suggesting that these processes occur largely within a hemisphere [@franconeriNatureStatusVisual2013]. The idea is that when when an object is tracked, the neurons representing that target in retinotopic cortical areas activate inhibitory connections to nearby neurons in the cortical map, suppressing the responses to neighboring objects. To explain the findings of hemifield specificity, an additional detail of the account is the idea that the inhibitory neural connections do not extend from one hemisphere's retinotopic map to another [@franconeriFlexibleCognitiveResources2013]. This is plausible because in classic crowding tasks, spatial interference does show a discontinuity across the left- and right-visual field boundary lends some plausibility to this idea [@liuReductionCrowdingEffect2009]. However, @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 found evidence against spatial interference extending any further than the classic crowding range, which is only half the eccentricity of an object - for example, an object placed six degrees of visual angle from where the point the eyes are looking at would be interfered with only by other objects closer to it than three degrees of visual angle [@boumaInteractionEffectsParafoveal1970]. Because in most studies of hemifield independence, the stimuli are not close to the vertical midline, their would not be an artifactual finding of hemifield independence due to less crowding across the midline. The more viable theory of hemifield independence, then, is that of two neural resources that span each hemifield.

A number of studies have found that the activity of some parietal and frontal areas of cortex increase steadily with the number of targets in MOT [@culhamAttentionResponseFunctions2001; @howeUsingFMRIDistinguish2009; @jovicichBrainAreasSpecific2001; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014; @nummenmaaCorticalCircuitBinding2017], consistent with the importance of a pool of attentional resources. Unfortunately, these studies did not focus on the extent to which these activations are specific to target load within a hemifield, so we cannot be sure whether the brain activation measured reflects the hemifield-specific resource or a more global resource. The only imaging study I am aware of that investigated the issue is @shimNumberAttentionalFoci2010 who found an activation difference when the objects designated as targets were in opposite hemifields compared to when they were in the same hemifield. This was found for the superior parietal lobule and transverse parieto-occipital area, suggesting that they may be part of the hemifield-specific resource. The difference was not found for the anterior intraparietal sulcus, which could mean its activation reflects a global resource <!--FUTURE-->. 
<!--"In behavioral performance, participants tracked with higher accuracy when the 2 target pinwheels fell in opposite hemifields than in the same hemifield. A corresponding difference in brain activity was observed in the SPL (P < 0.05) and TrPO (P < 0.005), where activity was higher for track-2 unilateral than track-2 bilateral. The visual field arrangement did not affect activity in aIPS, however (P > 0.10), revealing a possible further dissociation in the PPC between the anterior and posterior" -->

@stormerWithinhemifieldCompetitionEarly2014 used EEG to investigate the hemifield-specific resource. They found that the SSVEP activation for targets was higher than that for distractors, especially when the two targets were positioned in different (left and right) hemifields. In contrast, an ERP component known as the P3 thought to reflect more cognitive identification and decision processes was similar in the two conditions. This is consistent with the theory that tracking depends on both hemisphere-specific attentive processing followed by some involvement of higher-order processes that are not hemisphere-specific.

@battelliRoleParietalLobe2009 found they could disrupt MOT performance in a hemifield by stimulating the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Importantly, this only occurred when the moving targets were present in both hemifields. When the targets were all in the left or all in the right hemifield, TMS to the left or to the right IPS had no effect on tracking accuracy, and they replicated this in a second experiment. These findings bring to mind the competition between the two hemifields evident in the "extinction" symptom observed in parietal neglect patients. In extinction, responding to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to parietal injury only shows significant impairment if there are also stimuli presented to the ipsilateral hemifield. This inspired Battelli to explain their findings with two propositions. The first is that the IPS in each hemisphere can mediate the tracking of targets in *either* visual hemifield. The second is that under normal conditions, inhibitory processes reduce the amount of ipsilateral processing by each IPS, causing tracking capacity to effectively be hemifield-specific.

A rather complicated relationship of the hemispheres is also suggested by evidence from patients. @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 found that in patients with damage to their right parietal lobe, MOT performance only in the left visual field was impaired relative to control participants. Evidently the right parietal lobe does not normally mediate tracking in the right visual field, so losing it did not hurt right visual field tracking performance. For another task, however, these right parietal patients had substantial impairments in *both* hemifields. Impairment on that task, an apparent motion task, is believed to be a result of a deficit for registering the relative timing of visual events. The involvement of the right parietal lobe, but not the left parietal lobe, in judging the temporal order of stimuli in both hemifields was further supported in an additional study with both patients and with TMS applied to intact brains [@agostaPivotalRoleRight2017].

In summary, while there is evidence that each parietal lobe is involved in field-wide processing for some tasks, parietal areas also likely mediate the hemifield independence evident in some circumstances. Using ERP, @drewSoftHandoffAttention2014 found evidence that when a target crosses the vertical midline, say from the left to the right hemifield, the left hemisphere becomes involved shortly before the target reaches the right hemifield, and the right hemisphere remains involved for a short time after the crossing. Because this was modulated by predictability of the motion, it did not appear to be wholly mediated by the well-known overlap of the two hemispheres' receptive fields at the midline. This phenomenon may reflect the normally-inhibited ipsilateral representation of the visual field by parietal cortices highlighted by @battelliRoleParietalLobe2009, although this remains uncertain as the location the ERP signals originated from was not clear.

Regarding the cooperation between the hemifields necessary to keep tracking a target that travels from one hemifield to another, both @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 and @minamiHemifieldCrossingsMultiple2019 found evidence for a tracking performance cost when a target in MOT crossed the vertical midline. Evidently the handoff of control from one hemisphere to another is somewhat inefficient. @saikiRobustColorshapeBinding2019 also found some evidence in a memory paradigm that when two objects moved between hemifields, memory for their features was more disrupted than when they moved fron one to another quadrant within the same hemifield. @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 found no cost when targets moved between quadrants while remaining within a hemifield, an important finding given that other work raised the prospect of quadrant-specific resources [@carlsonQuadranticDeficitReveals2007]. 

In summary, areas of the parietal cortex may subserve both the hemifield-specific tracking resource that dominates most MOT tasks and the possible resource that is not specific to a hemifield. More work must be done, however, to determine the role of frontal lobe regions. Such regions could potentially play a role in the hemifield-specific resource, the hemifield-independent resource, or both.

## What else are hemifield-specific resources used for?

Multiple object tracking appears to be much like the spatial selection studied extensively in the visual attention literature, just applied to moving objects. Thus MOT suggests hemifield specificity of spatial attentional selection, and one should expect to find strong hemifield-specificity of other visual cognition tasks in addition to MOT. 

Prior to the discovery that MOT is highly hemifield-specific, many researchers had already, for various tasks, compared performance when the two stimuli are presented in the same hemifield to performance when they are presented in different hemifields. For example, @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971 found that the reporting of two briefly-presented digits is more accurate when the digits are presented in different hemifields than in the same hemifield. However, this study and many like it did not include a single-stimulus condition, so for the higher performance in the split condition, we don't know how close that is to the one-target level of performance and thus the degree of different-hemifield advantage cannot be quantified. Moreover, many studies use response time as a measure, which can be difficult to interpret quantitatively [@awhEvidenceSplitAttentional2000; @serenoDiscriminationHemifieldsNew1991; @dimondUseTwoCerebral1971]. 

<!-- A' is no good https://sites.google.com/a/mtu.edu/whynotaprime/ -->
@delvenneCapacityVisualShortterm2005 used both dual-target and single-target conditions in a visual working memory task. For spatial working memory, he estimated 40% hemifield independence, although unfortunately he used the discredited A' measure of performance [@zhangNoteROCAnalysis2005] and did not space the stimuli widely enough to reduce the possibility of spatial interference. Nevertheless, the advantage appears to be large and did not occur for color working memory [@delvenneVisualShorttermMemory2012]. More generally, only tasks with spatial demands seem to show much of a different-hemifield advantage [@holtBilateralAdvantageMaintaining2015; @umemotoBilateralAdvantageStorage2010]

@alvarezAnatomicalConstraintsAttention2012a studied visual search, with the stimuli to search arrayed bilaterally or unilaterally. They found only a small advantage of the vertical meridian split in a standard search task. However, in a subset search task where participants knew the target would be located in one of several locations designated by a pre-trial cue, they found a large bilateral advantage. When the relevant locations were visually salient (due to a color difference), this advantage largely disappeared. These results, and those in the rest of the literature, suggest that hemifield advantages are strongest when spatial selection is critical.

@strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 investigated working memory for stimuli that moved either within a hemifield or between hemifields. For between-hemifield movement, they found a substantial decrease in accuracy for the spatial task of remembering which positions of a 2x2 grid contained dots at the beginning of the trial, before the (empty) grid moved - 79% correct for between-hemifield movement, and 85% correct for within-hemifield movement. No such cost was found for color or identity memory tasks. This between-hemifield cost for spatial memory was similar to the cost they found for MOT itself.

This association between spatial tasks and a different-hemifield advantage may reflect a large-scale difference in how the brain processes spatial versus identity information. Famously, the dorsal stream to the parietal cortices are more concerned with spatial information than is the ventral stream, which is more involved in object recognition [@goodaleSeparateVisualPathways1992]. Neural responses in the dorsal pathway to parietal cortex are largely contralateral [@serenoMappingContralateralSpace2001], although as we have seen, this may depend on having stimuli in both hemifields. Largely contralateral responding is also found for other brain areas thought to contribute to a "saliency map" [@fecteauSalienceRelevanceFiring2006], such as the frontal eye fields [@haglerjrSpatialMapsFrontal2006], the superior colliculus [@schneiderVisualResponsesHuman2005], and the pulvinar [@cottonContralateralVisualHemifield2007a]. In contrast, identity-related processing seems to involve more bilateral neural responses and connectivity between hemispheres [@cohenUsingNeuronalPopulations2011; @hemondPreferenceContralateralStimuli2007].

Multiple identity tracking, which is discussed further in section \@ref(identity), combines the location-updating demand of multiple object tracking with an additional requirement to maintain knowledge of what features belong to each of the objects. Across four experiments, @hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 consistently found partial hemifield independence for this task, ranging from 26 to 37% (my calculations are [here](https://github.com/alexholcombe/tracking-review/blob/main/twoBrainsOrOne.Rmd)) with a paradigm that yielded `r round(100*HudHoweLittleMOTindependence)`% independence for MOT. This is consistent with the suggestion of the findings listed above that spatial selection and/or location updating processes are much more hemisphere-specific than processes that require maintenance of non-spatial features.

## Hemispheric differences

MOT and spatial selection appear to be limited by independent processing in the two hemispheres. Are these two hemispheres doing exactly the same thing, or do they have different strengths?

Functional differences between the left and right cerebral hemispheres can be attenuated at the behavioral level by the cross-hemisphere integration that occurs for many tasks prior to the stage that determines behavioral performance. The fact that tracking performance reflects more hemispheric independence, then, provides a higher potential to show hemifield differences than for most tasks. As it turns out, however, while differences are observed, they do not seem to be large.

In each of four experiments conducted in 2013, we found either a trend for or statistically significant advantage for targets in the right hemifield (Figure A2) [@holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014]. This was also found by @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020. <!--Interestingly, there was some non-significant evidence that this was greater in their one-target condition than in their two-target condition.    Figure 4 of @battelliUnilateralRightParietal2001 like Holcombe et al. (2014) finds (non-significant) better tracking performance in RVF than the left only when tracking one rather than more than one--> The right hemifield advantage could be explained by the idea that stimuli presented to the right hemifield are processed by both hemispheres to a greater degree than are stimuli presented to the left hemifield — this is thought to be why left neglect is more common than right neglect. Specifically, it is thought that the right hemisphere mediates attention to *both* hemifields [@mesulamSpatialAttentionNeglect1999], such that the right hemifield is doubly represented. However, while @strongHemifieldspecificControlSpatial2020 confirmed a right hemifield advantage in their MOT experiments, they found a *left* visual field advantage for spatial working memory experiments, even though spatial working memory is also thought to be mediated by parietal cortex. Most strikingly, @matthewsLeftVisualField2015 found a large advantage for temporal order judgments and simultaneity judgments for stimuli presented to the left hemifield. Neuropsychological evidence suggests that the left hemifield advantage for timing tasks reflects a specialization for timing in the right parietal cortex [@battelliBilateralDeficitsTransient2003], even though human specialization for language, which is thought to be in part an enhancement of timing and sequencing abilities, has occurred more in the left hemisphere.

The situation becomes more complex once one considers that subtle interactions between the two hemispheres seem to affect attention in each hemifield, as highlighted in the "the underlying mechanisms" section above. One illustration of this is a recent finding by @edwardsBehavioralGainFollowing2021. They had participants perform MOT in either hemifield for a 30 min session, and afterwards found that performance in the *untrained* hemifield improved significantly. The reason for this is not clear, but could reflect "fatigue" by the hemisphere contralateral to the trained hemifield, causing it to reduce its inhibition of the other hemisphere. Alternatively, the mechanism could be potentiation (an increase in gain) of the untrained hemisphere as a result of the deprivation, which may be the reason why depriving an eye results in increased cortical activity when that eye is stimulated later [@lunghiBriefPeriodsMonocular2011].

# Knowing where but not what {#identity}

What does a lay person mean when they say they are keeping track of something? If they are a parent referring to the rest of their family during an outing to a museum, that might mean knowing where their son is, where their daughter is, and where their spouse is. Notice that this suggests that they are aware of which person is where. But the conventional laboratory multiple object tracking task does not test peoples' knowledge of which target is where. The targets are typically all identical to each other and people need to report where the targets are, but not which is which.

This chapter is about what people know about the objects they are tracking. The basic answer is: surprisingly little. We should break the question down, however, into two questions. A first question is about how position updating works - does it use differences between the distractors' and targets' features to help keep track of the targets? A second question is about the extent to which the features of targets are available to conscious awareness.

## The first question: Does position updating benefit from differences in object identities?

### Motion correspondence 

For decades now, computer algorithms have been developed for object tracking and used to improve detection of intrusions and safety threats in industrial settings. They are also used in sports to analyze the movements of players of an opposing team's previous games, and in animal labs to monitor the movements of study subjects. When developing their tracking algorithms, engineers do not confine themselves to using only the locations and motions of objects - they also use the appearance of those objects, for example their shapes and colors. This helps the algorithm match objects across video frames (the correspondence problem, sometimes known in engineering as the "data association problem") [@yilmazObjectTrackingSurvey2006a]. This allows successful tracking in situations where location and motion alone would result in losing a target.  

Of course, the fact that object features would be useful for the brain to use in tracking does not necessarily mean that the brain does use them. The division of cortical visual signal processing into two streams, dorsal and ventral, hints that it might not. The dorsal stream, sometimes called the "where" pathway, specializes in motion and position processing, while the ventral stream, the "what" pathway, specializes in object recognition [@goodaleSeparateVisualPathways1992]. While the two pathways do interact, this  division raises the possibility that position updating might not involve much processing of objects' features. <!--"Perhaps most famously, these sorts of processes seem to be localized in anatomically distinct corti- cal streams (e.g., Livingstone and Hubel 1988), with the ventral pathway corresponding to identification, and the dorsal pathway corresponding to individuation. In addition, a variety of behavioral evidence supports this distinction." The surface features of objects (e.g., their colors and shapes), while obviously critical for many visual processes including object recogni- tion, seem to be largely discounted by many other processes (for a review, see Flombaum, Scholl, and Santos, in press). For example, surface features play little or no role in determining apparent motion correspondence (Burt and Sperling 1981), identity over time in the tunnel effect (Flombaum et al., 2004; Flombaum and Scholl 2006; Michotte, Thinès, and Crabbé 1964/1991), or object-specific priming (Mitroff and Alvarez 2007)." [@schollWhatHaveWe2008]-->

Over a century ago, Gestalt psychologists such as Max Wertheimer found that apparent motion was equally strong whether the objects in successive frames were identical or different [@wertheimerExperimentelleStudienUber1912]. Later studies found some effect of similarity, but the effect was weak [@kolersFiguralChangeApparent1971; @burtTimeDistanceFeature1981]. These findings contributed to the now-dominant view that the visual system does not use feature similarity much when computing motion correspondence to update a moving object's position. Some caution is justified, however, because
 when the successive presented frames of an object touch or overlap with each other rather than being presented in non-contiguous locations, the results can be different. The study of such displays, with a different object appearance (usually, shape) in two successive frames, is known as line motion or transformational apparent motion. These studies have found that feature similarity, especially contour continuity, but also color, can decide which tokens are matched [@faubertInfluenceTwoSpatially1995; @tseRoleParsingHighlevel1998]. Thus, feature similarity is involved in motion processing, even though in many situations motion correspondence is determined by spatiotemporal luminance relationships. An important characteristic of this process that does does not seem to have been studied, however, is whether the more complex cues characterized by @tseRoleParsingHighlevel1998 and others are processed in parallel. Short-range spatiotemporal luminance relationships ("motion energy") are known to be processed in parallel, by local detectors, yielding parallel visual search for a target moving in an odd direction defined by small-displacement apparent motion [@horowitzAttentionApparentMotion1994]. I am not aware of any studies that have investigated this for transformational apparent motion, in a situation where the perceived motion direction is determined by feature similarity <!--FUTURE-->. Thus, the possibility remains that feature similarity has its influence through what I have called a C=1 process (\@ref(Cequals1)).

<!--Unfortunately, it is difficult to test participants on whether they know during tracking the characteristics of an object when, as soon as the question is asked, they can focus their attention on the probed object and encode its features for report. But some insight into this issue can be gained by considering the studies conducted by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009.-->

### Feature differences, but not feature conjunction differences, benefit tracking

While only spatiotemporal luminance information, not other features, typically influence motion correspondence, another way that object featural information might benefit position tracking is via the action of feature attention. A clear case is if the targets differ in color from the distractors. It is well-established that attention can select stimulus representations by their color. One can, for example, enhance the selection of all red objects in the visual field. @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 confirmed that this process can benefit MOT. They used eight moving objects, four of which were targets. MOT performance was better than when the eight objects were different in color than when they were identical. This was also true when the objects were all different in shape.

Apart from the usefulness of attention to an individual feature when the targets differ in that feature from the distractors, do feature differences benefit tracking?  The answer seems to be no, because testing of feature *conjunctions* has found evidence that they don't help. In other paradigms, a large body of evidence has supported Treisman's theory that feature pairing information, in contrast to individual features, cannot efficiently guide attention to targets [ @treismanFeatureIntegrationTheory1980; @wolfeGuidedSearchUpdated2021]. It seems that the splitting of attention among multiple locations that occurs in MOT is similar to how attention is diffused over multiple stimuli in visual search and other paradigms, because @@makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 found that targets having unique feature pairings do not benefit tracking performance. In their "feature conjunction" condition, each object had a unique pair of features, while it shared the individual features with at least one other object. <!--create illustration maybe from diagrammeR--> Performance was no better in this condition than if the objects were all identical. <!--This finding is consistent with Anne Treisman's perspicacious thesis of over forty years ago that focused attention is needed for many sorts of binding. When tracking multiple targets, then, the pairing of the features cannot be used to distinguish targets from distractors. Only in the conditions where feature binding was not necessary did featural differences benefit tracking performance.-->

<!--Treisman, as well as many subsequent researchers, went further than this and theorized that feature pairing information only becomes available if attention focuses on -->

## The second question: Are we aware of the identities of objects we are tracking?

<!--FUTURE With the motion silencing illusion, it goes not occur for an object that one is tracking. I don't think any papers exist that make this point, or tell us whether the reason is because you're parsing away the motion from the change signal, or whether you actually have to compare feature values. Related phenomena are temporal camouflage and Saiki's original moving change blindness with occlusion findings . It also probably explains why infants don't process object features, because there is no cue to get them to update the object features.  Also the Wikipedia entry needs lots of work and should cite Saiki & Holcombe -->

We are of course aware of object features when the only task we are engaged in is tracking a single target. In that situation, our limited-capacity processes can all be applied to that target and, as there is only a single target, there is no need to maintain bindings between particular targets and particular features. However, when we are tracking multiple targets, the evidence indicates that we have little ability to report the objects' features, other than their locations, as we will see below.

<!-- A powerful demonstration that does not fully show lack of awareness of identities, but certainly shows how motion can obscure change in identities, is the motion silencing illusion [@suchowMotionSilencesAwareness2011]. If you have not seen it, I high recommend you [have a look](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-silencing/). The lack of awareness of the color changes succeeds partly because the color changes do not change the overall proportion of each color at a global level - this phenomenon was documented by @saikiBlindnessSimultaneousChange2012 in work prior to the discovery of the illusion. Another ingredient is the density of the display, which discourages ACTUALLY YOU CAN NOTICE THE CHANGES IF YOU TRACK, SO HOW IS THIS RELEVANT? -->

A common view among lay people seem to be that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in the central portion of our visual field, so unless an object actually disappears, moves to the edge of our visual field, or hides behind something or someone, we should always know where everything in the scene, and we should immediately detect any changes to these objects. Change blindness demonstrations are often the first experience that disrupts this belief.

Experiments suggest that during change blindness, although people cannot simultaneously monitor a very large number of objects for change, but they are able to monitor several, perhaps four or five [@rensinkVisualSearchChange2000]. They appear to do this by loading the objects into working memory and then, in the second frame of a change blindness display, checking whether any are different than what is held in memory.  People certainly can store several objects and rapidly compare these stored representations to the visual scene. However, loading into memory the features of objects for storage and subsequently comparing them to a new display with the objects in the same location may have different demands than maintaining awareness of the changing features of such objects. For one thing, it appears that hundreds of milliseconds are needed to encode several objects into memory [@vogelTimeCourseConsolidation2006; @ngiamVisualWorkingMemory2019]. Second, it appears that when objects are in motion, updating of their features is particularly poor, as we will see.

When Zenon Pylyshyn published the first theory of multiple object tracking, he had already devised the concept of FINSTs (Fingers of Instantiation), a small set of discrete pointers allocated to tracked targets. The idea was that each discrete pointer allows other mental processes to individuate and link up with an object representation, with the continued assignment of a pointer to a target facilitating its representation an object's representation as the same persisting individual [@pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989].

Pylyshyn's theory implied that when tracking multiple targets, people should know which target is which. Pylyshyn tested this and other predictions of his theory, and when the results turned out differently than expected, he published the results in two papers. The first paper was entitled "Some puzzling findings in multiple object tracking: I. Tracking without keeping track of object identities". In one study in that paper, targets were assigned identities either by giving them names or by giving them distinct and recognizable starting positions: the four corners of the screen [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2004]. At the end of a trial, participants had the usual task of indicating which objects were targets, but also were asked about the identity of the target - which one it was. Accuracy at identifying the targets was very low, even when accuracy reporting their positions was high. <!-- target-target confusions could explain this -->

More evidence for a disconnect between knowledge of what one is tracking and success at the basic MOT task was found by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007, who had participants track targets with unique appearances - in one set of experiments, they were cartoon animals. All the targets moved behind occluders at the end of each trial so that their identities were no longer visible. Participants were asked where a particular target (say, the rabbit) had gone - that is, which occluder it was hiding behind. This type of task was dubbed "multiple identity tracking" by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004. Performance was better than chance, but was much worse than performance for reporting the target locations irrespective of which target it was. The effective number of objects tracked, as reflected in a standard MOT question, was about four, but for responses about the final location of a particular animal, capacity was estimated as closer to two objects.

These results of MIT experiments suggest that our ability to update the location of one of multiple objects of interest is much better than our ability to maintain knowledge of what that object is. This harkens back to Pylyshyn's idea that tracking is mediated by pointers that in and of themselves, only point to locations and don't contain other featural information. Pylyshyn thought that these pointers, being unique and distinct, do provide us with knowledge of which target location at the end of a trial corresponded to a particular target at the beginning of a trial. However, his own experiments ruled against that - the tracking process seems to deploy something to the moving targets that carries absolutely no information about those targets other than their positions.

If we are given enough time, we certainly can update our representation of not only the locations of targets but of their features. For example, in visual short-term memory experiments, on successive trials people memorize different location-feature mappings for several objects. Thus, if moving objects were simply to move very slowly, we should be able to update our awareness of what is where before any target travels more than a trivial distance. However, a quite recent study yielded some results that further showcase the limitations of our identity updating abilities.

## Beaten by a bird brain

<!--For instance, @schollRelationshipPropertyencodingObjectbased2001 found that when items stopped moving, observers were able to accurately report the previous direction and speed of targets but not of nontargets. However, when the shape or color of the items was masked, observers were unable to accurately report the premask features of either targets or nontargets.-->

@pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 conducted a test that was, at its core, similar to Pylyshyn's experiments, with identical objects assigned unique identities. In their experiments, however, @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 used a format like a hustler's "shell game". The engaging nature of the shell game format made it suitable for testing children and an African grey parrot as well as human adults. This led to a few surprises.

For their stimuli, @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 used colored balls of wool. Real balls of wool, not pictures of such on a screen. Between one and four of the balls were shown to a participant by the experimenter. The experimenter then covered the balls with inverted opaque plastic cups, and began to move them, swapping the positions of first one pair, then another. After a variable number of pairs were swapped, the experimenter produced a probe ball of one of the target colors, and the participant's task was to point to (or peck on!), the cup containing the probed color. 

![An African grey parrot participates in a shell game. Pailian et al. (2020), CC-BY .](imagesForRmd/ParrotGriffinPepperbergShellGame.png){width=40%} 

At any one time, only two objects were in motion. The participants were responsible for knowing the final location of all the colors - there were no distractors. I think that many would have prediced that people would be able to perform this task with high accuracy, especially given that not only were only two objects in motion at any one time, the experimenter paused for a full second between swaps, which ought to give people sufficient time to update their memory of the locations of those two colors.

When only two balls were used, the results were unsurprising: over 95% accuracy, even for four swaps, the highest number of swaps tested. This was true of all three types of participants tested: the human adults, the parrot, and the (6- to 8-year-old) children. In the three-ball condition, for the children performance was near ceiling for the zero-swap (no movement) condition, but fell to close to 80% correct in the one-swap condition, and fell to around 70% correct for two and three swaps. The adults did better, but still their performance fell substantially with number of swaps, to about 80% correct for four swaps. Remarkably, the parrot actually outperformed not only the children, but also the human adults. Importantly, the parrot had not been trained extensively on the task, learning it primarily by simply viewing the experimenter and a confederate perform three example trials (the parrot was experienced with a simpler version of the task involving only one object presented under one of the three cups).

The biggest surprise here is that an African gray parrot had the ability to remember and update small sets of moving hidden objects to a level of accuracy similar to humans, despite having a much smaller brain than ours, less than one-fiftieth the size of our own in fact. Of course, this was an above-average parrot (selection bias surely was part of the reason it has been studied extensively), but still. Large parts of the parrot brain evolved after they split from our lineage [@iwaniukInterspecificAllometryBrain2005], so the fact that it can do this task, like us (or even better than us), appears to be an example of convergent evolution.

A second surprise was that the adult humans (in this case, Harvard undergraduates, who almost surely had above-average intelligence) displayed levels of accuracy that were not very high for the conditions that involved more than a few swaps. Remember that in these experiments, only two balls were moved at a time, and there was a one-second pause between swaps. Prior to the publication of this study, I had assumed that the reason for poor performance in multiple identity tracking was the difficulty of updating the identity of three or four targets simultaneously while they moved. I would have predicted that changing positions exclusively by swapping the positions of two objects, and providing a one-second pause between swaps, would keep performance very high. The @pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 results suggest that updating the memory of object locations is quite demanding. 

This finding was also surprising based on the long-popular concept of "object files" developed by @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992. The idea was that all the features of an object are associated with a representation in memory, the object file, that is maintained even as the object moves. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 showed a preview display with two rectangles, with a feature (in most experiments, a letter) presented in each. The featural information then disappears, and the rectangles move to a new location. The observer's representation of the display is then probed, for example by presenting a letter again in one of the rectangles and asking participants to identify it. @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992 found that if the letter was the same as the one presented in that rectangle at the beginning of the display, observers were faster to respond than if it had appeared in another rectangle in the beginning of the display, indicating that that aspect of the rectangle's initial properties was maintained, with its location updated. The focus in these studies was on simply demonstrating that this response time priming occurred at all, not in assessing what proportion of time it occurred.

Many researchers may have made the same mistake that I did of assuming that several object files could easily be maintained and updated. However, even in the original experiments of @kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992, they found that the amount of priming was greatly diminished when four letters were initially presented in different rectangles, indicating that fewer objects than that had letter information maintained and updated. They concluded that there may be a severe capacity limit on object files or object file updating. This was also supported by a pioneering study by @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002, who had participants view a circular array of colored discs that rotated about the center of the screen. Occasionally discs swapped color when they briefly went behind occluders, and the participants' task was to detect these color switches. Performance decreased dramatically with speed and number of discs, even though the motion was completely predictable, and @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 concluded that "even completely predictable motion severely reduces our capacity of object representations, from four to only one or two." Because we now understand that simple MOT does not work well across occluders, however, that interpretation of the study is limited by the absence of an MOT-type control. Nevertheless, the evidence from the studies in this chapter overall suggests that identity updating is very poor in a range of circumstances.

## Some dissociations between identity and location processing reflect poor visibility in the periphery

Why is it that participants cannot update the identities of the moving objects that they are tracking nearly as well as they can update their positions? The results of an eye-tracking study by the Finnish researchers Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä led them to conclude that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process. Eye movements during MOT were contrasted with eye movements during MIT, in which the targets and distractors were line drawings. During MIT, participants frequently looked directly at targets, for more than 50% of the trial duration, and frequently moved their eyes from one target to another. In contrast, during MOT, the participants moved their eyes infrequently, and their gaze wasn't usually at any of the moving objects, rather they were more often looking somewhere close to the center of the screen. @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 took these results to mean that the targets' identity-location bindings that must be updated during MIT are updated by a serial one-by-one process, whereas target positions during MOT are updated by a parallel process.

A problem for interpreting the @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 results is that participants may have had to update target identity information one-by-one purely due to limitations on human peripheral vision. That is, the targets (line drawings of different objects) likely were difficult to identify when in the periphery. Thus, participants may have had to move their eyes to each object to refresh their representation of which was which. Indeed, in a subsequent study, @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 tested discriminability of the objects in the periphery and found that accuracy was poor. <!-- The conclusion by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 that identities are updated by a serial one-by-one process that determines the movement of the eyes may well be correct.--> When colored discs were used as stimuli instead of line drawings, accuracy was higher in the periphery and participants did not move their eyes as often to individual targets. This suggests at least some degree of parallel processing, leaving the amount of serial processing,if any, in doubt, at least for simple colors, .

<!--@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016 did not assess how far in the periphery the target objects were identifiable - the only study I know of that did this is a later paper by the Finnish team, specifically @liModelMultipleIdentity2019. They tested discriminability of line drawings from the same database as those used by @oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016, while also testing the discriminability of faces and colored discs. More specifically, they first presented a sample stimulus at fixation (either a face, a line drawing, or a colored disc, depending upon the block of trials) and subsequently in the periphery they presented either the same stimulus or another stimulus from the same category. The task of participants was to judge whether this peripherally-presented stimulus was the same or different. For the faces and the line drawings, percent correct decreased a substantial amount with distance from the fovea. However, for the color task, percent correct was the same at all three eccentricities tested (2.5, 5, and 7.5 deg).    Forget a bit about what it looks like. don't have to classify among all the options-->

Unfortunately, many findings of differences between MIT and MOT performance may be explained by poor recognition of the targets in the periphery. Because most studies of MIT do not include an assessment of how recognizable their stimuli are in the periphery (@liModelMultipleIdentity2019 is the only study I know of that did this), it is hard to say how much of the difference between MIT and MOT can be attributed to this. I am not sure how one should equate object localization with object identifiability. One could blur the objects to impair localization but it is not clear what degree of spatial uncertainty is comparable to a particular level of object identifiability; this is the old apples-and-oranges problem.

One dissociation between identity and location tracking performance seems to remain valid regardless of the difficulty of perceiving object identities in the periphery. This is the original finding by @pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989, replicated by @cohenWhatwhereTradeoffMultipleidentity2011, that if targets are actually identical but are assigned different nominal identities, participants are very poor at knowing which is which at the end of the trial. Because in this paradigm, there is no visible identity information and participants knew this, poor vision in the periphery is not an issue.

## Evidence from two techniques suggests parallel updating of identities

<!-- To some extent, however, we're comparing apples and oranges. This study should be replicated with another sample of participants, however, and using a method that directly compares MIT (knowledge of target identities) to MOT (knowledge of targets' locations) by including distractors, not just targets. Without that, there is some concern that the presence of the experimenter was distracting or that some other idiosyncrasy of the paradigm led to poor identity performance.--> 

<!--These claims of a process that is serial and one-by-one are not based on rigorous tests of serial processing like those progressively elaborated by Jim Townsend and colleagues since the 1980s [@algomFeaturesResponseTimes2015; @townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Rather, it is based on more indirect evidence such as the visual search results that originally led Anne Treisman to propose a serial feature binding process.-->

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a used two techniques to investigate the possibility that serial processes are involved in multiple identity tracking. First, Howe et al. applied a simultaneous-sequential presentation technique that had previously yielded evidence for no serial processing in MOT [@howeDistinguishingParallelSerial2010]. Originally developed by @shiffrinVisualProcessingCapacity1972 to investigate briefly-presented stationary stimuli, the stimuli are presented either all at once (simultaneously) or in succession (sequentially) during a trial, half the stimuli presented in the first interval, and the other half in the second interval. The idea is that if a serial process is required to process each stimulus, performance should be better in the sequential condition, as in the two conditions the presentation duration of each stimulus is equated, but in the simultaneous condition a one-by-one process wouldn't have enough time to get through all the stimuli. The technique has been applied extensively to the detection of a particular alphanumeric character among other alphanumeric characters, and researchers have found that processing in the simultaneous condition is equal to or better than the sequential condition, [@shiffrinVisualProcessingCapacity1972; @hungSimultaneousBetterSequential1995], suggesting that at least four alphanumeric characters can be recognized in parallel.

For the MIT task, four targets of different colors moved among four distractors. Each of the four distractors was the same color as one of the targets, so that the targets overall could not be distinguished from the distractors by color. In the simultaneous condition, all the objects moved for 500 ms and then paused for 500 ms, with this cycle repeating throughout the trial, which varied randomly between 8 and 16 s. In the sequential condition, half the targets moved for 500 ms while the other half were stationary, and subsequently the other half of targets moved for 500 ms while the others remained stationary. This cycle repeated throughout the length of the trial. In two different versions of the experiment, performance was similar in the simultaneous and sequential conditions, supporting the conclusion that there was no serial process required for the task. This conclusion from @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a is limited, however, by its assumption that any serial process could respond efficiently to the pause of half the targets by shifting its resources to the moving targets, while not causing any forgetting of the locations and identities of the temporarily-stationary targets. To support this assumption, @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a pointed out that @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 had shown that attention could move at much faster rates than 500 ms per shift. However, the @hogendoornTimeCourseAttentive2007 studies did not assess the attention shifting time between unrelated targets, rather their shifts were for attention stepping along with a single target disc as it moved about a circular array. Thus, it is unclear how much the results of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a undermine the serial, one-by-one identity updating idea embedded in the theories of Oksama & Hyönä and @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019.

@howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a further investigated serial versus parallel processing in MIT by using another technique: the systems factorial technology of Jim Townsend and colleagues [@townsendSerialVsParallel1990]. Two targets were designated for tracking and presented in the same hemifield, to avoid independence by virtue of the hemispheres' independence [@alvarezIndependentResourcesAttentional2005]. The participants were told to monitor both targets as they moved and that if either of them darkened, to press the response button as quickly as possible, after which all the disks stopped moving and the participant was asked to identify the location of a particular target, for example the green one (the objects were identical during the movement phase of the trial but initially each was shown in a particular color). To ensure that participants performed the identity tracking task as well, only trials in which the participant reported the target identity correctly were included in the subsequent analysis. Detection of the darkening events was very accurate (95% correct). On different trials, either both targets darkened, one of them darkened, or neither of them darkened, and each could darken either by a small amount or by a large amount. <!--Because it's a response time analysis, it's measuring parallel or serial processing, which may be different somehow from possibly serial processing for individuating a target or solving the correspondence problem for it. In that case, the actual processing time is time-limited by the stimulus, whereas you can let a slow parallel accumulator eventually do its thing when the stimulus information isn't time-curtailed. In other words, attention might focus on one because it absolutely has to get done, but that would mean switching its strategy adaptively based on difficulty--> Based on certain assumptions, the pattern of the distributions of response time for the various conditions ruled out serial processing  and implicated limited-capacity parallel processing. This suggests that participants can process luminance changes of two moving targets in parallel while also maintaining knowledge of the identity of the moving targets. One reservation is that it is unclear how often the participants needed to update the target locations and refresh their identities, because the rate at which they needed to be sampled to solve the correspondence problem is unclear for the particular trajectories used. <!--The fact that identity tracking accuracy was over 95% suggests that the task was easy, but still--> It also would be good to see these techniques applied to targets defined only by distinct feature conjunctions, with no differences in features between the targets and the distractors. This would prevent any contribution of feature attention, and with processing of feature pairs likely to be more limited-capacity than that of identifying individual features, the results might provide less evidence for parallel processing.

<!--PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THIS, MOMIT 2.0 UPDATED -->

## Eye movements can add a serial component to tracking

Partially in response to the evidence of @howeIdentityLocationBindingProblem2015a against serial processing in tracking, Oksama and Hyona, with their colleague Jie Li, revised their Model of Multiple Identity Tracking (MOMIT) to involve more parallel processing, creating MOMIT 2.0. MOMIT 2.0 proposes that the "outputs of parallel processing are not non-indexed locations but proto-objects that contain both location and basic featural information, which can be sufficient for tracking in case no detailed information is required" [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. This is a reasonable response to the evidence, even if it unfortunately means the theory doesn't make as strong predictions, as the role of serial processing is now more vague. In MOMIT 2.0, serial processing is tied to eye movements and is used to acquire detailed visual information for refreshing working memory representations. @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 wrote that this "prevents the resolution of the active representations from declining. This is vital for tracking targets that require high-resolution information to be identified and kept distinguishable from other targets." The theory seems to be mute on whether serial processing would be involved if both fixation were enforced and the stimuli were easily identifiable in the periphery.

Here it is sensible to step back and consider the role of eye movements in more everyday behavior. People move their eyes on average three times a second, in part because like many other animals, our retina has a specialized part (the fovea) that is adaptive to direct at whatever object we are most interested in at the moment. In natural tasks, rarely is it the case that all  visual signals of interest are clustered together enough that they can be processed adequately without eye movements. Moreover, animals such as ourselves have strong drives for exploration and vigilance because we evolved in changing environments.

Eye movements normally contribute a serial, one-by-one component to processing, because as @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 highlighted, high-resolution information comes from only a single region on the screen - that currently falling on the fovea. Near-continual scanning of the visual scene is a deeply ingrained habit, and is also necessary for many artificial tasks, like reading. Not only are saccades frequent during reading, one influential theory of reading proposes that an internal rhythm drives saccades from one word to the next rather than them being triggered by the completion of a process such as word recognition [@engbertDynamicalModelSaccade2002]. Perhaps, then, one should expect frequent eye movements to occur and contribute a serial component of processing to a range of tasks even when eye movements are not necessary. People are  cognitively "lazy" in that they seem to structure eye movements and other actions in tasks so as to minimize short term memory requirements [@hayhoeTaskConstraintsVisual1998]. Thus, even if saccading to different targets were inefficient because people could keep information in memory, and update information in the periphery, people move their eyes anyway.

To move the debate regarding the role of serial and parallel processing forward, we should recognize that the frequent eye movements associated with natural behavior should be expected in tracking, as for any task involving multiple relevant stimuli, and this can contribute a serial processing component, even if people can perform the same task in a much more parallel fashion when eye movements are constrained. The most interesting evidence for serial processing, then, may be that found when eye movements are prohibited. The steep increase with load in apparent sampling frequency discovered by @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013 constitutes some evidence for that.

<!--The Finnish team of Lauri Oksama and Jukka Hyönä may have done the most studies of the task they dubbed multiple identity tracking (MIT) in 2004 [@oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004], introduced above in the version used by @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007. Based on results includning those I have reviewed here, since 2008 Oksama and Hyönä have been advocating a model that tracks the locations of moving objects with a parallel process, but updates other featural information with a serial, one-by-one process [@liModelMultipleIdentity2019]. -->

<!--They say Holcombe & Chen 2013 found big evidence for serial because "when objects move along the same trajectories (e.g., Holcombe & Chen, 2013) and/or are close to each other, high resolution information is required for discriminating the objects. Thus, tracking becomes more serial" but they don't seem to say anything about how different trajectories benefits performance-->


<!--Preventing the use of feature attention
The effectiveness of featural attention raises an important issue for the interpretation of MIT studies. All the MIT studies I reviewed above did not have targets and distractors distinguished only by their feature conjunctions; rather, they typically used unique shapes such as cartoon animals or line drawings. This raises the possibility that the targets sometimes shared some feature or features with each other more than with the distractors. In other words, feature attention could help separate the targets from the distractors. This could be avoided by using pairings of features, as in the feature conjunction condition used by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 for MOT. Another approach was used by Piers Howe and colleagues who paired each target, which had a distinct appearance, with a distractor that had an identical appearance.-->

To summarise this chapter, there is plenty of evidence that both use of object identities in tracking and the updating of target identities for awareness is quite poor. This fits with a much broader set of findings over the last thirty years, that the mind maintains fewer explicit visual representations than we intuitively believe. The first findings of change blindness, which were in the context of failures to detect changes that occurred during eye movements [@mcconkieRoleControlEye1979], led @oreganSolvingRealMysteries1992 to suggest that "the world is an outside memory" and later to discover change blindness [@rensinkSeeNotSee1997]. The idea was that the impression that one has a rich representation of all the objects in the visual field is an illusion, and instead that one has only a more limited knowledge, but that this is quickly supplemented by attentional processing when one becomes interested in a particular location or object. It appears that O'Regan's big idea goes further than he anticipated. While O'Regan suggested that only when objects were attended would they be fully processed, he did not suggest that one might be able to track the changing locations of multiple targets without becoming aware of what they are. Such lack of awareness has been documented not only in the context of tracking multiple objects as reviewed above, but even in a change blindness task that involved eyetracking of just a single target as part of an ongoing, more complex task [@trieschWhatYouSee2003].


<!--@hudsonHemifieldEffectsMultiple2012 multiple identity tracking , found a hemifield advantage: " Contrary to expectations, a bilateral advantage was still observed, though it was not as strong as when observers were not required to remember the identities of the targets.

<!--Tracking is important for representing objects still in view @tsubomiNeuralLimitsRepresenting2013-->



<!--
A second factor is that even when objects remain close enough to central vision to resolve their identities, a limited resource is required to bind their features together, including binding individual features with their location... 

A third factor is, of course, the limitations that result in imperfect performance even on tracking identical objects, reviewed in the previous sections..

You can track four objects without being able to identify stuff on the four objects. This could either be explained by attention needing to switch between locations, or alternatively that you just need less resource to track than to identify.

Because binding seems to require sustained attention, it’s unlikely it’s bound when serial attention isn’t there. But you might have a memory index of what is there - I need help on this from VWM people!-->


<!-- ## Configurations and 

Most models of tracking have assumed that people track only the targets, and track them without reference to the positions of any other objects. We know from other areas of research, however, that people rapidly extract that spatial layout or configuration of the objects in a scene. Some research has indicated that configural information is also used for tracking.

In sport, however, sometimes we are suprised to discover an opponent in the right place at the right time. "Where did he come from?" is a common complaint. This phenomenon can be partially understood in terms of the limit on the number of objects that can be tracked in MOT. It turns out, however, that this is only part of the story. The limitations on tracking are more profound than those we have reviewed so far.

The tracking research we have discussed so far has used targets and distractors that are all identical to each other (after the initial phase where the targets are indicated). In the real world, however, this is uncommon.

Visual short-term memory tasks typically find that people can perform reasonably well at storing at least four objects, allowing participants to detect whether an object changes during a short interval. This, together with the misconception discussed in section \@ref(bottlenecks) that tracking has a limit of four targets has led many researchers to suggest that a common limitation underlies both visual short-term memory and object tracking. This may be true in some sense, but certain possibilities have been ruled out by a dramatic finding.

<!--Putting objects in motion can dissociate tracking and short-term memory capacities. @saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 asked participants to track four colored discs that periodically moved behind occluders and then re-appeared on the other side. There were no distractors. The task of participants was to detect whether any discs changed color. Contrary to what would be expected from object files theory [@kahnemanReviewingObjectFiles1992], for all but very slow speeds, performance was very low. However, because distractors were not included, there was no direct comparison to performance tracking solely the objects' locations (without knowing their colors). -->

# Abilities and individual differences {#abilities}

For understanding the abilities that underlie multiple object tracking, so far we have discussed only the classic experimental approach of manipulating different factors within participants. This has led to our present understanding of the roles of spatial interference, temporal interference [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013], and the relationship to the processes underlying other tasks. However, a small but growing literature uses the individual-differences approach. In the individual-differences approach, the pattern of variation in scores on multiple tests is examined to see which abilities tend to go together. Those abilities that co-vary the most are thought to likely share more processes in common than those that don't.

## Do people vary much in how many objects they can track?

Individual-difference studies can require more than ten times as many participants as a within-participants experimental design investigating a large effect [@schonbrodtWhatSampleSize2013], but some studies do not use large samples. In addition to this shortcoming of the literature, there are also two very common other pitfalls in MOT and MIT individual-difference studies. 

@meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 tested fifty participants and for each one calculated the effective number of items tracked, for a display with four targets and four distractors. The modal effective number of items tracked was around two, but a substantial proportion of participants came in at three targets or one target tracked, and a few scored close to zero items tracked. @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 concluded that some participants could only track one or zero targets, while others can track more. Unfortunately, however, there is no way to know how much of the variation between individuals is due to motivation rather than ability. Measuring motivation reliably is difficult or impossible. Researchers can, however, include attention checks or catch trials to allow exclusion of participants who show clear evidence of not reading the instructions carefully, or frequently not paying attention. <!--also, they can design their study to look at the pattern of correlations--> This is one pitfall — failing to include a measure that checks whether each participant is blowing off the task.

@oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 were also interested in how many objects people can track. They managed to test over two hundred participants, and like @meyerhoffIndividualDifferencesVisual2020 they found what appeared to be a substantial variation in capacity, with some people able to track six objects, while many could track only two or even just one. However, no analyses were reported regarding the reliability of the MOT test. Their participants, who were provided by an air pilot recruitment program, were made up entirely of those who scored in the top 11% on intelligence test scores from a larger group. This provides some confidence that the participants were motivated<!--, although it is not clear whether the intelligence tests were administered in the same session, so one cannot know whether the participants were motivated during this particular session. -->

While we can be fairly confident that @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 used motivated paticipants, the study suffers from what I think of as the second pitfall - the failure to assess task reliability. On any test, a participant will tend to get somewhat different scores when tested on two different occasions, even if they did not learn anything from their first experience with the test. The extent to which participants' scores are similar when taking a test twice is known as test-retest reliability. Ideally, this is measured with two tests administered at very different times, but a more limited assessment is provided by dividing a single session's trials into two groups and calculating the correlation between those two groups, which is known as split-half reliability. Knowing the reliability can allow us to calculate how much of the variation in scores between participants is expected based on the noisiness of the test. Without knowing the reliability, there remains the possibility that the extreme variation in scores, with some participants' data indicating that they could only track one target, could be due to limited reliability - extensive testing of these participants might reveal that their low score was merely a fluke. 

Subsequent studies have assessed reliability, albeit only with the split-half measure rather than on separate days. Still, the reliabilities they have found for MOT are extremely impressive - 0.96 [@huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012], 0.85 [@wilbiksIndividualDifferencesMultiple2020], 0.92 [@trevinoHowWeMeasure2021], and 0.87 [@eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018], near the highest of all the tests administered. Moreover, many basic cognitive and attentional tasks have notoriously low reliabilities [@hedgeReliabilityParadoxWhy2018]. Tasks with low reliabilities are not well suited for individual-differences studies - as mentioned above, individual-difference studies are largely based on measuring the pattern of correlations between tasks to reveal the relationship among abilities. The lower the reliability of a task, the harder it is to reliably measure the correlation with another task.  

What do these high reliabilities mean for tracking? It suggests that the large individual differences observed by @oksamaMultipleObjectTracking2004 and others are actually real. Evidently, some young, healthy, high-intelligence people can really only track one target. Second, the high task reliability of MOT means that individual-difference studies are a viable  avenue for gaining new insights about tracking and its relation to other mental abilities.

In the general population, ageing is likely a major source of individual differences in MOT, as older participants perform much worse than younger participants [@trickAgerelatedDifferencesMultipleobject2005; @sekulerAgerelatedChangesAttentional2008; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017]. Using a task requiring participants to detect which of multiple objects had changed its trajectory, @kennedyEarlyAgerelatedDecline2009 found a steep performance decline between 30 and 60 years — the effective numbers of trajectories tracked in a multiple trajectory tracking task dropped by about 20% with each decade of aging, which could not be explained by a drop in visual acuity. This is interesting in itself, and is something that theories of aging and attention ought to explain. This result must also color our interpretation of individual-difference studies using samples with a wide age range — some of the correlations with other tasks will likely be due to those abilities declining together rather than them being linked in people of the same age. That's still useful for drawing inferences, but the inferences should perhaps be different than from individual-difference studies of undergraduates.

Researchers have taken what one might call a wide-angle approach to MOT individual difference studies. They've tested participants with a wide variety of tests, to see which mental abilities are linked. However, the first large-scale study concentrated on tasks typicaly thought of as attentional [@huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012]. Liqiang Huang and his colleagues used tests of conjunction search, configuration search, counting, feature access, spatial pattern, response selection, visual short-term memory, change blindness, Raven's test of intelligence, visual marking, attentional capture, consonance-driven orienting, inhibition of return, task switching, mental rotation, and Stroop. In a sample of Chinese university students (age not reported, but presumably mostly young adults), many of these tasks showed high reliabilities of over 0.9, meaning that there was a potential for high inter-task correlations (inter-task correlations are limited by the reliabilities of the two tasks involved). However, the highest correlation of a task with MOT was 0.4. The task was counting, which required judging whether the number of dots in a brief (400 ms) display were odd or even. Change blindness, feature access, visual working memory, and visual marking were runner ups with correlations of around 0.3. 
<!-- @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 "For each variable, reliability was estimated by calculating the split-half (odd-even) correlations and the Spearman-Brown formula was used for adjustment. All of the 17 paradigms met the minimum reliability of 0.7."  So I guess these are not raw correlations he reports from then on -->

That no task had a higher correlation is very interesting, but also disappointing. It's interesting because it suggests that MOT involves distinct abilities from several other tasks that have previously been lumped together with MOT as being "attentional". This is also disappointing, first because it suggests that our theoretical understanding of these tasks is sorely lacking. It's also disappointing because the low correlations mean that it's hard to discern the pattern of correlations, e.g. from most correlated to least correlated with MOT - when the highest correlations is 0.4, one needs very narrow confidence intervals to be confident of the ordering of the tasks.
<!--, although another possibility is that the way people are different from each other has little to do with the--> 

@trevinoHowWeMeasure2021 reported data from a test of more than 400 participants, an opportunity sample of people aged 18 to 89. They tested a set of cognitive, attentional, and common neuropsychological tasks: arithmetic word problems, the trail-making task, digit span, digit symbol coding, letter cancellation, spatial span, approximate number sense, flanker interference, gradual onset continuous performance, spatial configuration visual search, and visual working memory as well as MOT. MOT had among the highest reliabilities, at 0.92. MOT performance had little correlation with performance on the task designed to measure sustained attention over an extended period (about five minutes, the gradual-onset continual performance task [@fortenbaughSustainedAttentionLife2015]. This supports the tentative conclusion that the ability to sustain attention without lapses is not an important determinant of tracking performance.

In the @trevinoHowWeMeasure2021 inventory, the task that most resembled the counting task found by @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 to have a high correlation with MOT was an approximate number sense task, which had a moderate correlation of 0.3. The approximate number sense task differed from the counting task of @huangMeasuringInterrelationsMultiple2012 by not testing the subitizing (less than 5 items) range, which might help explain any discrepancy. Indeed, @eayrsEstablishingIndividualDifferences2018 found, using hierarchical regression, that subitizing made a contribution to predicting MOT performance that was somewhat separate to that of an estimation task using larger set sizes. <!-- change blindness, load-induced blindness and multiple object tracking, MOT split-half reliability of .87 -->

The tasks with the highest correlations with MOT in the data of @trevinoHowWeMeasure2021 were visual working memory, spatial span, letter cancellation, and digit symbol coding, all at around 0.5. As the authors pointed out, the letter cancellation and digit symbol coding tasks are complex tasks believed to reflect a number of abilities. This makes it hard to interpret their correlation with MOT. Spatial span and visual working memory are quite different from MOT, but similar to each other in that they both involve short-term memory for multiple visual stimuli.

Overall, there is a reasonable level of agreement across these individual-differences studies, as well as others not reviewed here, such as @trickSpatialVisuospatialWorking2012. They agree that visual working memory has a robust correlation with MOT performance, which is particularly interesting because superficially, MOT imposes little to no memory demand. Many researchers conceive of tracking as simply the simultaneous allocation of multifocal attention to multiple objects, with a process autonomous to memory causing the foci of attention to move along with the moving targets.

From the consistently strong correlation of MOT performance with visual working memory, it is tempting to conclude that mechanistically the two tasks are tightly linked. However, it must be remembered that working memory tasks are among the best predictors of a wide range of tasks, including intelligence as well as the Stroop task, spatial cuing, and task switching [e.g. @redickWorkingMemoryCapacity2006].

## Going deeper

Variation in multiple object tracking is unlikely to be caused by just one ability. From three decades of work, we now understand that tracking performance can be limited by spatial interference and temporal interference, as well as less task-specific factors such as lapses of attention.

Unfortunately, no individual difference study to date seems to have attempted to partial out the possible components of MOT (e.g., spatial interference versus temporal interference, as in @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013) to see whether they show different patterns of correlations with other tasks. In the realm of spatial interference with static stimuli, even studies with small sample sizes have revealed substantial individual differences [@petrovAsymmetriesIdiosyncraticHot2011], such as larger crowding zones in some types of dyslexia [@jooOptimizingTextIndividual2018]. It's possible that these differences form a large part of inter-individual differences in MOT. There is also evidence that training with action video games can reduce spatial interference and improve reading ability [@bertoniExcessiveVisualCrowding2019], making it especially important to investigate spatial interference further.

With the growth of online testing, the sample sizes required for individual difference studies have become easier to obtain, and so individual differences are a promising future direction. However, researchers who are more familiar with the issues and analyses of within-subjects studies must be aware of the different issues that are important for individual-differences studies, such as the pitfalls reviewed in the beginning of this chapter.

<!--In Huang et al.’s study, the correlation between MOT and VWM was .30, the correlation between (configuration) search and MOT was .30, and the correlation between search and VWM was .23. In our data, however, MOT and VWM were much more closely correlated with each other (.51)-->

# Towards the real world

Some of the findings in multiple object tracking are useful for understanding real-world situations. A naive view of visual perception and attention is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, and some people such as sports coaches may think that unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, players should know where everyone in front of us on the basketball court, or the soccer field, is at all times. Similarly, during driving many people seem to assume that they are aware of all hazards in their visual field. The fact that this is not accurate has been incorporated into driver education [@fisherCanNoviceDrivers2006].

Change blindness demonstrations can rapidly dispel naive beliefs about visual awareness of change, but still people assume that if they are actively attending to a moving object, they will be aware of its features. As we have seen (Chapter \@ref(identity)), this is not true, although tracking something does make it more likely that a change will be detected. This was supported in a simulated driving study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014, who found that changes were found more accurately and rapidly when the change was made to a target vehicle rather than a distractor vehicle.

Few empirical studies, unfortunately, have made strong links between real-world situations nad laboratory MOT tasks, or its underlying abilities. @bowersCanWeImprove2013 found that laboratory MOT performance did not predict driving test performance as well as either the Montreal Cognitive Assessment task, a trail-making task, or a subtest of a useful field-of-view task. The aforementioned driving simulator study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014 found that drivers were more accurate at localizing which of multiple lead vehicles braked if it was a tracking target, but there was no advantage in terms of braking response time. 

@mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 used a multiple object avoidance task where the user used a mouse to control one of the balls that they had to prevent from colliding with the other balls. The task is reminiscent of the venerable Asteroids game mentioned in the beginning of this book. @mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 found strong correlations with performance on a driving simulator and with years of driving experience. In an earlier paper, some of these authors found that the MOA correlated better with driving performance than conventional MOT [@mackenzieLinkAttentionalFunction2017]. 

In sports, some teams of researchers have frequently suggested that MOT performance predicts in-game performance in soccer and other sports, and further reported evidence that training on MOT tasks can enhance skill in sports. Unfortunately, the associated evidence is not strong [@vaterCriticalSystematicReview2021]. Given the poor record of computer-based training tasks (sometimes called "brain training") in improving skills in other real-world domains, one should remain skeptical that MOT training has benefits until rigorous evidence is provided [@simonsBraintrainingProgramsWork2016].

# Progress and recommendations {#recommendations}

The study of multiple object tracking has traditionally been done in the laboratory, with only a few dozen participants in an experiment. Only recently, then, has one of the greatest virtues of the MOT task become clear: it's high test-retest reliability, of approximately .8 or .9, among the highest of attentional tasks (see Chapter \@ref(abilities)). The outlook for future work, then, is positive both from the prospect of new results being credible (because with a non-noisy task, less data is needed to have high statistical power) and for the use of MOT as a tool to study individual differences.

To further highlight how much we have learned in the last thirty-odd years, next I will describe how much findings have allowed us to disconfirm multiple aspects of the first and most influential theory of tracking, Zenon Pylyshyn's FINST theory.

<!--
Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.

Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance. -->

## The decline of Pylyshyn's FINST theory

At the time of writing, Pylyshyn's FINST theory is the featured theory on the "multiple object tracking" Wikipedia page [@wikipediaeditorsMultipleObjectTracking2021], and it is frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well. However, some main features of the theory have been rebutted [@schollWhatHaveWe2008].

Core to the theory is the idea that tracking is mediated by a fixed set of discrete, preattentive indices. As we have seen, however, as speed increases, the number of targets that can be tracked rapidly decreases, to one target, which is hard to explain with a fixed set of discrete indices [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012].

Adding to the evidence that tracking draws on attentional resources are dual-task studies. I did not have space to review them in this Element, but they indicate that tracking draws on attentional resources shared with some other tasks  [@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014]. One should add, however, that such studies do not seem to have ruled out the possibility that these findings were caused entirely by a C=1 resource rather than the hemifield-specific tracking processes; unfortunately, none of these studies appear to have tested for the hemifield specificity of their findings.

One prediction of Pylyshyn's theory was that participants should be aware which target is which among the targets they are tracking. Pylyshyn himself found strong evidence against this, and the evidence  for poor updating of target identities has increased since then.

<!--Although CDA findings suggest there is something tracking number of objects rather than resources expended @drewVogel @balabanObjectRepresentationsVisual2016, I don't know that it supports a limit on this -->

## Topics not covered by this book

Many topics that I originally planned to cover could not be included in this Element (I was given a word limit by the publisher). Some of the most important are whether tracking operates in a retinotopic, spatiotopic, or configural representation (see [@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992; @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020; @howeCoordinateSystemsUsed2010; @meyerhoffDistractorLocationsInfluence2015b; @liuMultipleObjectTrackingBased2005; @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021]), the role of distractors and possible distractor suppression, the role of surface features [@papenmeierTrackingLocationFeatures2014], and the literature on dual-task paradigms, although a few dual-task papers were mentioned along the way [e.g., @alvarezMultielementVisualTracking2005]. <!--The use of velocity signals -->

If your favorite topic is not covered, possibly you can take some consolation in the fact that my own favorite topic, the temporal limits on tracking [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017; @howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011], also was not covered. I hope to address this topic, which has major implications for what the tracking resource actually does during tracking, and whether processing is serial or parallel, in a separate manuscript. <!--early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992], this recently has been questioned, and now is a favored account of tracking in some circumstances, as reviewed in Chapter \@ref(serialOrParallel).-->

* For computational modelling, I don't recommend modelling only data from standard, fairly unconstrained trajectories, as such data may not constrain models enough. Show your model successfully mimics both spatial crowding and temporal interference effects, including that temporal interference is more resource-intensive than spatial interference. Another strategy is to model large sets of data at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from only one or a few different MOT experiments.

## Dual-task OUT OF SCOPE

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

Dual-task 

Alvarez, G.A., et al., Are mutielement visual tracking and visual search mutually exclusive? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2005. 31(4): p. 643-667.

There seems to be an especially close link between MOT and subitizing
@trickAgeDifferencesEnumerating2003 observed that even very slow motion reduced
enumeration speed for stimuli containing 6–9 items, while
the enumeration of 1–4 items was not affected when items
were in motion. Similarly, @alstonSubitizationAttentionalEngagement2004
presented static and moving items, finding that faster and
more accurate enumeration occurred in the subitizing range
given the presence of moving items.

psilocybin seems to impair MOT but not visual working memory [@carterUsingPsilocybinInvestigate2005] 

Subitizing no bilateral advantage on accuracy, but that could be due to very high accuracy - when looking at response time, an advantage is found, although not clear it's as large as that for MOT @railoBilateralTwoitemAdvantage2014

"The results indicated that the number of items participants could subitize decreased by one for each item they tracked." @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011

 "concurrent performance of a MOT task and a VWM task still instilled substantial and load-dependent dual-task costs. " @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006

@allenMultipletargetTrackingRole2006

object tracking in people with Williams Syndrome remains at the level of 4‐year‐olds, whereas the ability to remember multiple locations of static objects develops further. @ohearnDevelopmentalProfilesMultiple2010 

@howardVisualSpatialAttention2020 "for a purely spatial task, perceptual attention (TRACKING?) and working memory appear to recruit separate core capacity-limited processes."

@souzaContributionsVisualCentral2017 argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources." "Distracting visual attention, but not central attention, impaired MOT performance"
-->


## Recommendations

Here are a few recommendations for multiple object tracking researchers that have emerged from our journey through the literature:

* To dilute the influence of C=1 processes, use several targets, not just two or three. But remember that even with several targets, a small effect could be explained by a  C=1 process, so consider that. Test for hemifield specificity as that can also rule out C=1 processes.

* Always test for hemifield specificity! In addition to it helping to rule out a factor having its effect only on C=1 processes, we know very little about what limited-capacity brain processes are hemisphere-specific, so any results here are likely to be interesting.

<!--The effect increases with retention interval, and may be a more cognitive mechanism, as it has been suggested that  Rep- resentational momentum occurs in memory for implied motion stimuli and  neither of which elicits pursuit eye movements.-->
