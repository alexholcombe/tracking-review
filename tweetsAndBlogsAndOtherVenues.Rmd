## Nature Reviews Psychology   schubertt@gmail.com or twitter

Hi Teresa, I hope you are well. The first Nature Reviews Psychology issue looks really cool. I’m messaging you now because I’m interested in writing for the journal. I recently wrote a book (32,000 words) on multiple object tracking and what it tells us about visual attention.

Somehow it reveals properties of the attentional system that are obscured with stationary objects.

To those who would explain it with a parallel theory, the central puzzle is why temporal resolution is resource-intensive but spatial resolution isn't.
