# Identities and feature binding

A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone is at all times. In sport, however, sometimes we have the experience of suprise when an opponent is in the right place at the right time and we think, "Where did he come from?". If we lost track of the player, he may have moved a considerable distance before we noticed him again. This phenomenon can be partially understood in terms of the limitation on the number of objects that can be tracked in MOT tasks. It turns out, however, that the limitations on tracking are more profound than this.

The tracking research we have discussed so far has mainly used targets and distractors that are all identical to each other (after the initial phase where the targets are indicated). In the real world, however, this is uncommon.

Visual short-term memory tasks typically find that people can perform reasonably well at storing at least four objects, allowing participants to detect whether an object changes during a short interval. This, together with the misconception discussed in section \@ref() that tracking has a limit of four targets led many researchers to suggest that a common limitation underlay both visual short-term memory and object tracking. It suprised many, subsequently, that putting objects in motion yielded a strong dissociation between tracking capacity and short-term memory performance.

@saikiMultipleobjectPermanenceTracking2002 asked participants to track four colored discs that periodically moved behind occluders and then re-appeared on the other side. The task of participants was to detect whether any discs changed color. For all but very slow speeds, performance was very low when there were four discs to be monitored. This  

Further evidence has indicated that during tracking, while the locations of targets are updated and available, other aspects of them may not be. Indeed, even knowledge of which target is which can be lacking.

In one experiment, targets were assigned distinct identities either by giving them names or by giving them distinct starting positions (the four corners of the screen) [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2004]. At the end of a trial, participants were asked not only to indicate which objects were targets but also the identity of the target. Accuracy at identifying the targets was very low, even when accuracy reporting their positions was high. <!-- target-target confusions could explain this --> In his visual indexing theory of tracking, @pylyshynRoleLocationIndexes1989 had conceived of each target being referenced by its own discrete pointer. But the discovery that one did not know which target is which undermined this idea. 

Subsequent research further documented the disconnect between success at MOT and knowledge of what one is tracking. @horowitzTrackingUniqueObjects2007a had participants track targets that looked very different from each other - in one set of experiments, they were cartoon animals. At the end of a trial, all the targets moved behind occluders so that their identities were no longer visible. Participants were asked where a particular target (say, the rabbit) had gone - that is, which occluder it was hiding behind. Performance was better than chance, but was much worse than performance for reporting the target locations irrespective of which target it was. The effective number of objects tracked, as reflected in a standard MOT question, was about four, but when asked to locate an individual animal, their capacity was closer to just two objects.

@pailianAgeSpeciesComparisons2020 devised a simple shell game that allowed testing how well children and an African grey parrot as well as human adults can update the memorized locations of an array of colors.

The task used brightly-colored woolen pompoms. Between one and four of the pompoms were shown to a participant and then covered by inverted plastic cups, after which different pairs of cups were swapped a variable number of times. As a probe, the participant was presented with one of the target colors, and the task was to point, or peck, to the cup containing the probed color. 

In a way, this might be expected to be much easier than a conventional MOT task, because only targets were presented, no distractors, and at any one time, only two objects were in motion. Moreover, the objects paused for a full second between swaps, presumably giving participants time to update their working memory of the locations of the colors.

When there were only two pompoms presented, performance in all groups was high. Interestingly, the parrot did at least as well as the human adults, and outperformed them in the three-pompom condition. Evidently, the ability to remember and update small numbers of moving hidden objects very well evolved even in our distant cousins with much smaller brains.

With four pompoms, performance fell with the number of swaps, declining to below 80% correct even for the parrot and the adult humans.

<!--For instance, @schollRelationshipPropertyencodingObjectbased2001 found that when items stopped moving, observers were able to accurately report the previous direction and speed of targets but not of nontargets. However, when the shape or color of the items was masked, observers were unable to accurately report the premask features of either targets or nontargets.-->

The results from these studies suggest that participants often cannot remember the identities of some of the moving objects that they are tracking. Indeed, trying to remember object identities may actively interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. However, in the studies reviewed above the objects were invisible, at least temporarily, so that memory was required to bridge a spatiotemporal gap. If the distinct appearances of the targets were made continuously visible, one would hope that one could better maintain a representation of their appearances, especially considering that the objects were continuously stimulating ones' retinas.

It is difficult to test participants on whether they know during tracking the characteristics of an object when, as soon as the question is asked, they can focus their attention on the probed object and encode its features for report. Insight into the issue can instead be gained by considering the studies conducted by @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009.

In the @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 experiments, eight moving objects were presented, and each was distinct in color, another feature such as shape, or both features. Tracking performance was better than when the eight objects were identical. However, when the eight objects were not all distinct on a single feature and instead were only distinguished by their pairing of features (feature conjunction), the results were quite different. To clarify, in this condition, each object has a unique pair of features, but shared its individual features with at least one other object. Performance in this conjunction condition was no better than if the objects were all identical. @makovskiFeatureBindingAttentive2009 concluded that while differences among objects could benefit tracking, as if participants were using both object identity and location to distinguish objects, this was only the case if feature binding was not necessary. It is possible that global feature attention, utilized by activating the colors of the targets for instance, might account for the distinct identity advantage in the featural case.

In the early 1990s, it slowly dawned on researchers that the mind contained fewer visual representations than they assumed. Failures of trans-saccadic visual fusion and inability to detect changes that occurred during eye movements [@mcconkieRoleControlEye1979] led @oreganSolvingRealMysteries1992a to write a paper whose title included the phrase "the world as an outside memory" and to discover change blindness [@rensinkSeeNotSee1997a].

, and then the discovery of change blindness, led researchers to 

there was less to visual perception than they had assumed.

A second factor is that even when objects remain close enough to central vision to resolve their identities, a limited resource is required to bind their features together, including binding individual features with their location... 

A third factor is, of course, the limitations that result in imperfect performance even on tracking identical objects, reviewed in the previous sections..

You can track four objects without being able to identify stuff on the four objects. This could either be explained by attention needing to switch between locations, or alternatively that you just need less resource to track than to identify.

Because binding seems to require sustained attention, it’s unlikely it’s bound when serial attention isn’t there. But you might have a memory index of what is there - I need help on this from VWM people!

<!-- ## Configurations and 

Most models of tracking have assumed that people track only the targets, and track them without reference to the positions of any other objects. We know from other areas of research, however, that people rapidly extract that spatial layout or configuration of the objects in a scene. Some research has indicated that configural information is also used for tracking.

Let's return to the classic shell game. In a shell game, an item is placed beneath one of three identical shells, making that shell the target. The viewer tries to keep track of which shell has the item underneath it.
