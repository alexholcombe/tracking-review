# Bottlenecks and capacity {#bottlenecks}

Consider a simple problem in arithmetic. What is fourteen times eight? I am sure you can calculate that product, but it might take you a few seconds to do so. And if I set you two problems rather than just one, for example I asked you to also divide sixty-eight by seventeen, you would do the two problems one at a time. Indeed, our minds may be completely incapable of doing two such problems simultaneously [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002; @zylberbergBrainRouterCortical2010a].

Such limitations are somewhat remarkable given that each of our brains contains more than 80 billion neurons. In particular, our  profound limitations speak to the importance of the architecture of the mind, in particular its bottlenecks, to understanding our abilities.

Of course, multiplying and dividing two-digit numbers are not something that most of us do every day. A task we do have daily practice with, however, is reading. Yet despite the years of practice, a large body of psychological research suggests that humans can read at most only a few words at a time, and much researcher further indicates that we can only read *one* word at a time [@whiteEvidenceSerialProcessing2018; @reichleEncodingMultipleWords2009]. It seems, then, that at least some of the bottlenecks of human information processing are a fixed property of our processing architecture.

In this context, the term 'bottleneck' makes sense if one imagines a standard soft drink bottle. Most of the volume of the soft drink is in the bottom, wide part of the bottle. If one holds the bottle upside-down, most of the contents of the bottle will press down on the narrow neck, and this neck restricts the rate at which the contents can exit the bottle. As a metaphor for the mind, a large volume of signals from across the visual field press up against more limited-capacity brain areas. The large volume of visual signals is crated by the large array of neurons that we have in the retina and a few subsequent areas that process signals in parallel.

The parallel processing prior to the bottlenecks is sufficient to get certain tasks done. In the below display, for example, you should be able to find the blue objects very quickly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.height = 2.0, fig.width=2.5}
#bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png ?
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
pts<- expand.grid(x = seq(2,16,2), y = seq(2,16,2), type = c("distractor"))
jittr<-.4
pts$x <- pts$x + runif(length(pts$x))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$y <- pts$y + runif(length(pts$y))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$type <- as.character(pts$type)
pts$type[c(1,4,6,8,11,12,13,16,20,25,26,30,33,37,41,44,47,48,52,55,59,60)] <- "distractor2"
pts$type[c(13,26,46)] <- "target"

ymin<-600; ymax<-2000
ggplot(pts,aes(x=x,y=y, color=type)) + geom_point(size=6)  +  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "none")
#+ ylim(ymin,ymax)
```

Our visual system processes each of the shapes simultaneously, which can make the locations of the blue objects available very rapidly when you choose to attend to blue. Some brain areas, however, do not have neurons that can recognize objects dedicated to each bit of the visual field. Instead, their simultaneous processing capacity is limited. The processes required to recognize words are one example.

For a limited capacity process such as word recognition to do its job, something is needed to pick out, from a crowded scene, just one or a few objects for these processes to recognize. This something is often referred to as *selective attention*. <!--Different visual abilities seem to have different capacities, and it is not at all clear that a common selective attention process is responsible for gating all of their inputs.-->

While word recognition may only be able to process one word at a time, and some visual searches reflect processing that can be described as massively parallel, other processing falls somewhere in between. That is, the processes underlying some of our abilities are limited in capacity, but not as limited as word recognition seems to be. As we will see, object tracking is a case in point.

One or two myths about object tracking have become fairly widespread, and one of them relates to the nature of tracking's capacity limit, so before delving deeper into that issue, in the next section I will first address that myth. 

<!--CROSS-CHECK WITH PSYC2016 TEXT
@duncanSelectiveAttentionOrganization1984 was interested in how many objects we can process at a time. He found that accuracy for making a simple visual judgment about an object was much worse when one needed to simultaneously make a judgment about another. For example, participants were asked to judge whether a briefly-presented rectangle was small or large and also judge whether a simultaneously presented line was dotted or dashed. Performance was worse FOR the two-object condition even in comparison to a single-object condition where two judgments also needed to be made. The participants had to make either two judgments about a single object or one judgment about one object and the second judgment about a different object. To Duncan, his finding that performance was substantially worse in the two-object condition indicated the existence of a bottleneck at a stage that processes objects. He wrote that 

> Findings support a view in which parallel, preattentive processes serve to segment the field into separate objects, followed by a process of focal attention that deals with only one object at a time.

This conclusion was an over-reach. Performance was better than one would expect if only one object were processed, unlike what has been found for word processing. Duncan could explain that by saying that the presentation time was adequate for focal attention to, on *some* trials, process more than one object. Alternatively, however, it may be that the relevant processes *can* handle two objects at a time, but they do so more poorly than for one object. Work that credibly claims that a visual ability is truly limited to one object at a time is hard to find; the reading of words may be an exception.-->
