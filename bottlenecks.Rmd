# Bottlenecks, resources, and capacity {#bottlenecks}

Quickly, what is fourteen times eleven? Calculating that in your head probably takes you a few seconds or more. And if I set you two problems rather than just one, for example by asking you to also divide sixty-eight by seventeen, I'm sure you would do those problems one at a time. Indeed, our minds may be completely incapable of doing two such problems simultaneously [@oberauerAccessInformationWorking2002; @zylberbergBrainRouterCortical2010a].

Such limitations are remarkable given that each of our brains contains more than 80 billion neurons. The problem is not a lack of neurons, really, but how they are arranged - our mental architecture.

Multiplying and dividing two-digit numbers feels like a rather abstract problem, and not something we do each day. So you might think that if we were doing lots of such problems each day, we could do more than one at a time. This is probably wrong - consider that a task we do have daily practice with is reading. Yet despite years of reading dozens if not hundreds of words a day, a large body of evidence suggests that humans can read at most only a few words at a time, and much research further indicates that we can really only read *one* word at a time [@whiteEvidenceSerialProcessing2018; @reichleEncodingMultipleWords2009]. It seems, then, that at least some of the bottlenecks of human information processing are a fixed property of our processing architecture.

To flesh out the way I'm using the word 'bottleneck', consider a standard soft drink bottle. Most of the volume of the soft drink is in the bottom, wider part of the bottle. If you invert the bottle, most of its liquid contents will press down on the  neck. The narrowness of the neck restricts the rate at which the contents can exit the bottle. Similarly, a large volume of signals from sensory cortex ascending the cortical hierarchy would press up against higher areas that are more limited in capacity. The large volume of visual signals is partly a result of the retinotopic organization of the retina and sensory cortex - each has multiple neurons dedicated to each bit of the visual field, all working in parallel. 

The parallel processing happening in sensory cortices gets a number of tasks done, so that higher stages can save the trouble. These tasks include the encoding of motion direction throughout the visual field, as well as color and orientation. A local and regional differencing operation happens for these features, resulting in salience, such that odd features become conspicuous in our visual awareness. In the below display, for example, you should be able to find the blue objects very quickly.

```{r findBlue, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Thanks to featural attention, you should be able to find the blue circles very quickly.", fig.height = 2.0, fig.width=2.5}

pts<- expand.grid(x = seq(2,16,2), y = seq(2,16,2), type = c("distractor"))
jittr<-.4
pts$x <- pts$x + runif(length(pts$x))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$y <- pts$y + runif(length(pts$y))*jittr-jittr/2
pts$type <- as.character(pts$type)
pts$type[c(1,4,6,8,11,12,13,16,20,25,26,30,33,37,41,44,47,48,52,55,59,60)] <- "distractor2"
pts$type[c(13,26,46)] <- "target"

ymin<-600; ymax<-2000
ggplot(pts,aes(x=x,y=y, color=type)) + geom_point(size=6)  +  theme_void() + theme(legend.position = "none")
#+ ylim(ymin,ymax)
```

Orienting mechanisms direct attention to colors or orientations that differ from their surroundings. This is only possible because massively-parallel retinotopic brain areas have orientation- and color-tuned neurons. For other judgments, higher, post-bottleneck brain areas that are very limited in capacity are critical. The visual word form area of in the occipitotemporal sulcus of the left hemisphere needed to recognize words is one example [@whiteParallelSpatialChannels2019]. Being limited in processing capacity to just one stimulus, the word-recognizing process will not recognize a word in a crowded scene until something directs to it the visual signals from a word. We often use the term *selective attention* to refer to this "something" that directs particular visual signals through the bottleneck to limited-capacity processes. <!--Different visual abilities seem to have different capacities, and it is not at all clear that a common selective attention process is responsible for gating all of their inputs.--> If there were no bottlenecks, there would be no need for selection, until the point of action [@allportSelectionActionBehavioral1987].

So far the picture I have painted is one of entirely feed-forward processing, with a torrent of visual signals impinging on a narrow bottleneck of signals that continue onward. But cortical processing is rarely a one-way street, and the way visual attention works is no exception. Visual attention seems to work in large part by biasing processing within visual cortices, rather than leaving that unchanged and blocking all but a few signals at a later bottleneck stage. It may be the limits on the control signals from high-level (possibly parietal) cortex that restrict processing capacity as much as does a structural convergence of visual signals as they penetrate the brain.

A resource metaphor is more apt if limited capacity is a result of a finite pool of neural resources in parietal cortex that biases which visual signals are cognitively processed. I suspect that neither way of thinking is entirely correct. Restricted neural populations for controlling visual processing may be a limiting factor, but so may be neural convergence, amounting to a bottleneck-like aspect of neural architecture. Thus I will sometimes use the term "limited resource" when referring to how we are restricted in how many visual representations are processed.

The word "resource" has the useful connotation that people can choose how to apply their finite processing capacity, as a resource is something that is available and can be used in different ways. For example, it suggests that one can use three-quarters of one's processing capacity for one target while using the other quarter for a second target. As mentioned previously, there is evidence that people can favor one target over another when tracking both [@chenResourceDemandsObject2013; @croweGoaldirectedUnequalAttention2019].

While word recognition seems to be able to process only one stimulus at a time, other visual judgments may be limited in capacity relative to sensory processing, but have a capacity greater than one. Object tracking seems to be one such ability. Certainly by the coarse performance measures typicaly used in the literature, the processing involved in tracking multiple objects seems to be simultaneous, although researchers haven't fully ruled out the possibility that tracking multiple objects happens via a one-by-one process that rapidly switches among the tracked objects.

The existence of very limited-capacity processes illuminates why object tracking is important. By having the location of moving objects of interest in mind, we are able to rapidly deploy all our attentional resources to any one of the objects. This allows more limited-capacity processes to deliver rapid results. <!-- seems to be necessary to, for example, make fine shape discriminations or recognize a word.-->

<!--A major misconception about object tracking has become widespread, and it relates to the nature of tracking's capacity--> limit. <!--See the next section.-->

<!--CROSS-CHECK WITH PSYC2016 TEXT
@duncanSelectiveAttentionOrganization1984 was interested in how many objects we can process at a time. He found that accuracy for making a simple visual judgment about an object was much worse when one needed to simultaneously make a judgment about another. For example, participants were asked to judge whether a briefly-presented rectangle was small or large and also judge whether a simultaneously presented line was dotted or dashed. Performance was worse FOR the two-object condition even in comparison to a single-object condition where two judgments also needed to be made. The participants had to make either two judgments about a single object or one judgment about one object and the second judgment about a different object. To Duncan, his finding that performance was substantially worse in the two-object condition indicated the existence of a bottleneck at a stage that processes objects. He wrote that 

> Findings support a view in which parallel, preattentive processes serve to segment the field into separate objects, followed by a process of focal attention that deals with only one object at a time.

This conclusion was an over-reach. Performance was better than one would expect if only one object were processed, unlike what has been found for word processing. Duncan could explain that by saying that the presentation time was adequate for focal attention to, on *some* trials, process more than one object. Alternatively, however, it may be that the relevant processes *can* handle two objects at a time, but they do so more poorly than for one object. Work that credibly claims that a visual ability is truly limited to one object at a time is hard to find; the reading of words may be an exception.-->
