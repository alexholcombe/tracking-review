Is it just another paradigm for studying attention? No - hemisphere independence, where but not what.

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?-->

Attention was one of the earliest topics of scientific psychology. By "scientific psychology", I mean the tradition of laboratory studies that arguably began in the late 19th century. In 1890, William James famously provided a definition of attention that began with "It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought." At this time, plenty of experiments were being done, using custom apparatus such as devices that measured response time and presented auditory and visual stimuli.

Hugo Münsterberg, one of the first with a laboratory that studied attention, was highly interested in attention and moving stimuli. His 1916 book **The Photoplay: A Psychological Study** described his theory of the cinema, and included a twenty-page chapter on attention.

When psychology and the study of attention grew rapidly following World War II, the study of visual attention was dominated by static stimuli, often stimuli presented briefly with a tachistoscope. Very few researchers used moving objects, and this continued until the 1980s. This was, in part, a technology issue. Scientific laboratories, or psychology laboratories at least, lagged the technology being introduced to arcades and even of homes. In 1979, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced the game Asteroids. <!-- (https://youtube.com/embed/YJZ0hB0Vnyk) -->

The point of the game was to shoot and dodge the asteroids that traveled across the screen from all directions. It paid to monitor multiple moving asteroids simultaneously, to determine which way one should move, or shoot, to prevent a collision. Psychologists, however, were slow to take up the programming of computers to present stimuli, and even slower to use them to create moving stimuli.

Psychologists were slow to use the associated technology to study how people attended to multiple moving objects. In the 1970s, however, Zenon Pylyshyn was pondering the possibility of a primitive visual mechanism capable of "indexing and tracking features or feature-clusters" (as he put it in @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; I haven't been able to get copies of his 1970s reports) as they moved. In 1988,  @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 programmed an Apple II+ computer to create a display with ten identical objects moving on random trajectories,  and connected a telegraph key with a timer to record response times. Finally, he connected an early eyetracker to detect eye movements away from fixation and trigger termination of a trial. Thus he was able to investigate the ability to covertly, without eye movements, keep track of moving objects.

In the experiments of @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988, up to five of the ten moving objects were designated as targets by flashing at the beginning of the trial. The targets then became identical to the remaining moving objects, the distractors, and moved about randomly. It was immediately apparent that people could do this. While viewing the display, one has the experience of being aware, seemingly continually, of which objects are the targets and how they are moving about. In [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAQM4QJRYV8) embedded below, one is first asked to track a single target to become familiar with the task, and then subsequently four targets are indicated, at different speeds.

But @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 also showed that the processes that underlie tracking are limited in the number of targets that they can faithfully track. Periodically, one of the moving objects flashed, and if the flashed object was a target, the participant was to press the telegraph key. Errors increased fairly rapidly as the number of targets was increased, from 2% of target flashes missed when only one of the objects was a target, to 14% of target flashes missed when five of the objects were targets. 

Long before Zenon Pylyshyn and Ron Storm devised an experiment to formally document this phenomenon, the notion of keeping track of moving objects was already familiar from everyday life. Any adult who has ever been responsible for more than one child while at the beach or at the park has attempted to continuously monitor the locations of those children. Probably every parent has experienced the sudden panic when, perhaps while chatting with some friends, one realizes that one has lost track of a child. On the sports field, players often concentrate on keeping track of the locations of multiple team-mates, the locations of opponents, and their spatial relationships to the ball. In conference halls, scientists monitor the position and posture of other researchers relative to the ones they are chatting to, in order to best time their approach.

<!-- On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles.  At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water.--> 
<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move  and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey)-->.

You won't find much about tracking in chapters about visual attention. The study of visual attention is still dominated by stimuli that don't move. At the same time, what little most psychology researchers think they know about object tracking is wrong. In this book, we'll bust a few myths about tracking and see that studying it has yielded some unique insights about our limited capacities. 

<!--
Keeping track of something that is moving implies that our mind is continually, or at least frequently, updating a representation of its position. Most researchers seem to conceive of this as keeping spatial attention on an object, a sort of spotlight or hill of neural activation that glides across retinotopic cortex. There is evidence for this from neuroimaging. In this article, for simplicity we will refer to the spatial index that changes along with a moving object as a spotlight of attention. This spotlight account is consistent with evidence that probes are more easily detected on targets than elsewhere [@pylyshynPuzzlingFindingsMultiple2006; @searsMultipleObjectTracking2000]. Keep in mind, however, that we do not mean that a hill of activation in spatiotopic or retinotopic cortex exhausts all the processes involved in tracking - there are certainly more.
-->

<!--Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

Without continuous attentional selection, you not only lose your children

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens.

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.
