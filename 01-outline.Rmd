## Tracking task short description and anecdotes

It is sometimes important to maintain one's attention on a moving object. Every parent knows this. At the playground, or at the beach, or at a school event, carers often find themselves monitoring specific children as they move among other moving children. On the sports field as well, players often find themselves trying to keep track of multiple team-mates and opponents and their spatial relationships to the ball. The first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced Asteroids, a game in which one must dodge irregular polygons streaming in all directions.

In Asteroids, it pays to monitor more than one of the moving objects, to determine which way one should move, or shoot, to prevent a collision. Asteroids was introduced in 1979, but psychologists were slow to use the associated technology to study how people processed multiple moving objects. Finally, in 1988, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988a conducted an ingenious experiment using an Apple II+ computer. Pylyshyn & Storm showed that people can keep track of multiple moving objects designated as targets in a crowd of identical distractors.

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens. 

For the generations of children since 1979, when Asteroids was invented, 

You won't find much about this ability in chapters about visual attention. This is partly because for decades, the study of visual attention used only still, un-moving objects. 

The study of visual attention took off in the 1970s with work by Eriksen, Treisman, . We learned an enormous amount about *static* objects.

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding 

a huge topic, but 

This will make the case for tracking being much more important than people realize.  but you can't even perceive spatial relationships.


The manuscript would start with a few anecdotes illustrating why keeping track of objects is important both today (e.g., keeping track of one's children at the beach, keeping track of particular players on the sports field<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the teamâ€™s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move -->) and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey). Then it would transition into some basic background about the visual system. Descriptions of the the draft sections are below. These section descriptions showcase that multiple, typically separate literatures would be integrated.

## Outline

**Basic background**. 

**Object representations**. 

**Resources or spatial interference.** The limitations in our abilities could emerge from multiple limits in our brain's processing. For visual stimuli, one such limitation is a flexible resource, while another such limitation is spatial interference. These concepts will be elucidated in this section (benefiting in part from two papers from my lab), and the experiments that have led to our present understanding that both play a role will be described.

**Two brains or one?** The fact that the brain is made up of two separate hemispheres has some striking consequences for object tracking , and more subtle ones for other tasks involving keeping objects in mind. This section will review the research regarding the remarkable hemifield independence of multiple object tracking (including two papers from my lab), as well as the specificity for spatial attention tasks - non-spatial measures of working memory show little independence, implicating a more unitary resource.

<!-- **Different resources for different tasks** The brain can do some tasks with remarkably little interference between them, while others are  -->

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.

**Serial processing, parallel processing, or both?** The way that our limited capacities are allocated over time to multiple objects, that is whether in parallel or in rapid series, has been a long debate. Recent evidence (including one of my papers) points to a serial component that seems to relate to natural oscillations in the brain, but much is yet to be determined.

**Misconceptions and questions**



**Towards the real-world** and real-world tasks. A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone on the bacsketball court is at all times. Bringing together the factors described in previous sections, and bringing in new ones such as limits on feature binding, we will analyze some real-world tasks.
