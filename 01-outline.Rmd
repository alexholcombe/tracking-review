## Tracking task short description and anecdotes

On the road, drivers monitor the movements of others’ vehicles. In conference halls, scientists monitor the position and posture of other researchers relative to the ones they are chatting to, in order to best time their approach. At the beach, parents keep watch as their children move in and out of the water. On the sports field, players often find themselves trying to keep track of multiple team-mates and opponents and their spatial relationships to the ball.

How do we do this and what does that tell us about how the mind works?

Until the late 1980s, almost no-one who studied attention used moving objects. Partly this was a technology issue, even though in 1979, the first popular home game console, the Atari, introduced Asteroids.

The task was to shoot and dodge the asteroids that are streaming in all directions. It pays to monitor more than one of the moving objects, to determine which way one should move, or shoot, to prevent a collision. Psychologists were slow to use the associated technology to study how people processed multiple moving objects. Finally, in 1988, @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988 used an Apple II+ computer to conduct an experiment that demonstrated that people could keep track of multiple moving objects. Pylyshyn & Storm showed that people can keep track of multiple moving objects designated as targets in a crowd of identical distractors.

It was immediately apparent that the ability to track had a rather dramatic capacity limitation. That is, performance dropped quite rapidly as the number of targets was increased.

For the particular object trajectories and speeds used by some researchers

This ability was also immediately observed to have a severe capacity limit. 

Researchers quickly latched onto the word "attentional" to describe this ability, 
in part because various 

Along the way we will bust myths such as the common notion that people can track four or five objects, 

Is object tracking just sustained attentional selection, when the objects happen to be moving? Well, a first question fundamentally is how do you keep your attention on the object? The literature on visual search is enormous but is almost exclusively about finding

And today, children frequently try to track rapidly moving objects in their own home - like many other things, tracking has come to screens. 

For the generations of children since 1979, when Asteroids was invented, 

You won't find much about this ability in chapters about visual attention. This is partly because for decades, the study of visual attention used only still, un-moving objects. 

The study of visual attention took off in the 1970s with work by Eriksen, Treisman, . We learned an enormous amount about *static* objects.

This will make the case for tracking being much more important than people realize.  but you can't even perceive spatial relationships.


The manuscript would start with a few anecdotes illustrating why keeping track of objects is important both today (e.g., keeping track of one's children at the beach, keeping track of particular players on the sports field<!-- In basketball, the player needs to track the individual players of her/his own team, for example to know where the team’s excellent 3-point scorer is currently located. Similarly, a car driver approaching a busy intersection needs to track the whereabouts and movement trajectories of other vehicles and pedestrians in order to decide his/her own move -->) and in evolutionary history (e.g., keeping track of the weakest members in a herd of prey). Then it would transition into some basic background about the visual system. Descriptions of the the draft sections are below. These section descriptions showcase that multiple, typically separate literatures would be integrated.

## Outline

**Intro** 

**Bottlenecks** 

**Which aspect(s) of tracking determine performance?**

1. C=1 processes
1. Duration one can sustain attention
1. Spatial selection of multiple locations, even static ones
1. Spatial interference
1. Temporal interference
1. Speed limit of attention-following

Each of these could hinder performance more with more targets. They contribute in an unknown mix to most trakcing tasks .
Thus we don't know which is responsible for various results. This has afflicted the quest to understand serialOrParallel,

**speed, and time.** The physical parameters that can limit tracking performance are space, speed, and time. Each plays a role in different circumstances, but the temporal limits are the most misunderstood, as I have discovered in reviewing journal manuscripts over the years, even though they may be the most fundamental. This section will explain spatial limits, speed limits, and temporal frequency limits on tracking (based in part on three papers from my lab), and how they illuminate other issues such as the relationship of tracking to basic motion and position perception.

**Serial processing, parallel processing, or both?** The way that our limited capacities are allocated over time to multiple objects, that is whether in parallel or in rapid series, has been a long debate. Recent evidence (including one of my papers) points to a serial component that seems to relate to natural oscillations in the brain, but much is yet to be determined.

**Misconceptions and questions**

**Towards the real-world** and real-world tasks. A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone on the bacsketball court is at all times. Bringing together the factors described in previous sections, and bringing in new ones such as limits on feature binding, we will analyze some real-world tasks.
