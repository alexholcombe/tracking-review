# Progress and recommendations {#recommendations}

Near the beginning of this book (\@ref(intro)), I flagged four important findings from the literature. Here they are again:

1. Target load has little effect on spatial interference, whereas temporal interference increases steeply with target load (Section \@ref(spatialInterference)).
1. Predictability of movement paths benefits tracking, but only for one or two targets, not for more (Section \@ref(Cequals1)).
1. Tracking capacity is hemifield specific: one can double capacity by dividing targets between the hemifields (Section \@ref(twoBrains)).
1. When tracking multiple targets, people often don't know which target is which, and updating of non-location features is poor (Section \@ref(identity)).

I hope you now agree that these claims are quite well supported.Something that's not really a finding about how tracking works, but is another important result, is MOT's high test-retest reliability, of approximately .8 or .9, which is among the highest of attentional tasks (Section \@ref(abilities)). MOT is thus an excellent task not only for the insights we've already gained into mental processes, but also because we can expect future results to be credible (because with a non-noisy task, less data is needed to have high statistical power) and because MOT has high potential for revealing individual differences.

## How far have we come?

Pylyshyn's FINST theory of MOT was published way back in 1988 and was the very first theory of tracking. Despite hundreds of published studies since then, today in 2022 FINST theory is the only theory mentioned on the "multiple object tracking" Wikipedia page [@wikipediaeditorsMultipleObjectTracking2021], and it continues to be frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well. However, some main features of the theory have been rebutted [see also @schollWhatHaveWe2008]. Core to Pylyshyn's theory was the idea that tracking is mediated by a fixed set of discrete, preattentive indices. As we have seen, however, as speed increases, the number of targets that can be tracked rapidly decreases, to one target, which is hard (although not impossible) to explain with a fixed set of discrete indices [@alvarezHowManyObjects2007; @holcombeExhaustingAttentionalTracking2012].

Core to the FINST concept was that participants should be aware which target is which among the targets they are tracking. Pylyshyn himself found strong evidence against this, and the evidence for poor updating of target identities has increased since then (important finding #4 above). Explaining the dissociation between position updating and non-position maintenance and updating of features is a core part of two recent theories, those of @liModelMultipleIdentity2019 and of @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019. Both theories are in agreement with Pylyshyn's proposition that position updating happens in parallel, but they suggest that other features are maintained and updated by a process with a capacity of one that switches among the targets serially. @lovettSelectionEnablesEnhancement2019 also posits that the serial process, by visiting a target, can compute its motion history, to explain important finding #2, that predictability of motion trajectories yields a measurable advantage only when there are only a few targets [@howeMotionInformationSometimes2012; @luuExtrapolationOccursMultiple2015].

The notion of parallel position updating but serial feature maintenance and updating can explain a lot of results, but some evidence about both position updating and feature maintenance is difficult to explain this way. I go into depth in another manuscript on the complex issue of serial versus parallel processing in multiple object tracking [@holcombeMultipleObjectTracking].

## Recommendations for future work

We haven't made nearly as much progress in understanding the processes underlying tracking as I would have hoped after more than thirty years of work. A truly great advance was the discovery that tracking's capacity limit reflects two resources, one in each hemisphere. What's disappointing is how little that discovery has been built on. For example, an important question is whether tracking draws on the same resources as other attentional tasks. According to FINST theory, the tracking process is preattentive, but dual-task studies show a lot of behavioral interference with other tasks [@oksamaPositionTrackingIdentity2016; @alnaesPupilSizeSignals2014] (I did not have space in this Element to review these). Sadly, however, such studies do not seem to have ruled out the possibility that these findings were caused entirely by a process with a capacity of only one object (what I have called System 2) rather than the hemifield-specific tracking processes. Testing for the hemifield specificity of the interference can help us to find out<!--FUTURE-->. 

“Carving nature at its joints”, or dissociating the components of something, is important for scientific progress but can be difficult in psychology [@fodorModularityMind1983]. General cognition, including System 2, can do many different things and thereby contaminate the study of other aspects of object tracking. I don't want to see more missed opportunities to study what makes tracking distinctive, hence my top recommendations for future research emphasize this point. Those recommendations are:

* To dilute the influence of capacity-one System 2 processing, use several targets, not just two or three. But remember that even with several targets, a small effect could be explained by a capacity-one process. Test for hemifield specificity as that can also rule out a capacity-one process.

* Always test for hemifield specificity! In addition to it helping to rule out a factor having its effect only on a capacity-one process, we know very little about what limited-capacity brain processes are hemisphere-specific, so any results here are likely to be interesting.

* As we have seen, MOT is a complex task, so it's difficult to interpret individual differences in the overall task or how they will translate to other tasks. Individual-difference studies should use task variations that help isolate the component processes that contribute to overall success or failure, such as spatial interference, temporal interference, and cognitive processing.

* For computational modelling as well, don't model only standard MOT tasks with unconstrained trajectories, as such data may not constrain models enough. Show that a model succeeds at task variations that isolate component processes. <!--Another strategy is to model datasets at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from only one or a few different MOT experiments.-->

## Topics not covered by this book

Many topics that I originally planned to cover could not be included here (I was given a word limit by the publisher). Some of the most important are whether tracking operates in a retinotopic, spatiotopic, or configural representation (see [@yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992; @billHierarchicalStructureEmployed2020; @howeCoordinateSystemsUsed2010; @meyerhoffDistractorLocationsInfluence2015b; @liuMultipleObjectTrackingBased2005; @maechlerAttentionalTrackingTakes2021]), the role of distractors and possible distractor suppression, the role of surface features [@papenmeierTrackingLocationFeatures2014], and the literature on dual-task paradigms. <!--The use of velocity signals -->

If your favorite topic was left, I hope you can take some consolation in the fact that my own favorite topic, the temporal limits on tracking [@holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017; @howardPositionRepresentationsLag2011], also was not covered. Because that topic has major implications for what the tracking resource actually does during tracking, and whether processing is serial or parallel, I am writing a separate manuscript about it [@holcombeTimeClearImposes]. <!--early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling [@pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992], this recently has been questioned, and now is a favored account of tracking in some circumstances, as reviewed in Chapter \@ref(serialOrParallel).-->

## Dual-task OUT OF SCOPE

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

Dual-task 

Alvarez, G.A., et al., Are mutielement visual tracking and visual search mutually exclusive? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2005. 31(4): p. 643-667.

There seems to be an especially close link between MOT and subitizing
@trickAgeDifferencesEnumerating2003 observed that even very slow motion reduced
enumeration speed for stimuli containing 6–9 items, while
the enumeration of 1–4 items was not affected when items
were in motion. Similarly, @alstonSubitizationAttentionalEngagement2004
presented static and moving items, finding that faster and
more accurate enumeration occurred in the subitizing range
given the presence of moving items.

psilocybin seems to impair MOT but not visual working memory [@carterUsingPsilocybinInvestigate2005] 

Subitizing no bilateral advantage on accuracy, but that could be due to very high accuracy - when looking at response time, an advantage is found, although not clear it's as large as that for MOT @railoBilateralTwoitemAdvantage2014

"The results indicated that the number of items participants could subitize decreased by one for each item they tracked." @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011

 "concurrent performance of a MOT task and a VWM task still instilled substantial and load-dependent dual-task costs. " @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006

@allenMultipletargetTrackingRole2006

object tracking in people with Williams Syndrome remains at the level of 4‐year‐olds, whereas the ability to remember multiple locations of static objects develops further. @ohearnDevelopmentalProfilesMultiple2010 

@howardVisualSpatialAttention2020 "for a purely spatial task, perceptual attention (TRACKING?) and working memory appear to recruit separate core capacity-limited processes."

@souzaContributionsVisualCentral2017 argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources." "Distracting visual attention, but not central attention, impaired MOT performance"
