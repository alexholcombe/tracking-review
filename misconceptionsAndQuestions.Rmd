# Misconceptions and questions

Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.

Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance. 

## The decline of Pylyshyn's FINST theory

We've come a long way. One way to see that is

These findings rebut Pylyshyn's theory that tracking reflects preattentive indices [@schollWhatHaveWe2008]

"Our pupil data (see also Alnæs et al., 2014) indicate that both MIT and MOT are attention-demanding (thus ruling out preattentive models, such as FINST of Pylyshyn, 1989), " @oksama

"whereas at high speeds, only one target could be tracked. This is strong evidence against Pylyshyn’s (1989, 2006) account, which predicts that capacity should be constant."

Although CDA findings suggest there is something tracking number of objects rather than resources expended @drewVogel @balabanObjectRepresentationsVisual2016, I don't know that it supports a limit on this

But the CDA suggests there 

At the time of this writing, Pylyshyn's theory is the featured theory on the Wikipedia page for multiple object tracking, and it is frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well.

Further undermines Pylyshyn's conception

Early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992

It is well-known that a decrease with target load, linear or non-linear, can be explained by parallel models as well as serial models.

## Recommendations

Always use several targets, not just two or three, to dilute the influence of C=1 processes.

Always test for hemifield specificity.

The effect increases with retention interval, and may be a more cognitive mechanism, as it has been suggested that  Rep- resentational momentum occurs in memory for implied motion stimuli and  neither of which elicits pursuit eye movements.
