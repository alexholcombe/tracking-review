# Misconceptions and questions

Top misconceptions about MOT
* its capacity limit is around 4 items.(this has been used to argue that it has a similar capacity limit to visual working memory (Cowan, 2001).)
* "While the most intuitive model of multiple object tracking would involve storing the locations of targets in spatial memory, then moving attention in turn as quickly as possible to each target to update its location, this class of model is unable to account for MOT performance (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988; Vul et al., 2009)"

Reading your paper also gave me an idea to have a Common Misconceptions section for the Cambridge Element.  One might be that the capacity limit on VWM and MOT coincide (what you refer to as "The most striking link between the two tasks is that they seem to have a similar capacity limit of around four items (Cowan, 2001)". I totally agree that it is striking and so it is natural to think it means something, but while I don't know much about VWM, the capacity limit for MOT is determined by the speeds, spatial proximities,and temporal frequencies used, so as you know the limit can be anything between zero and more than ten.  It is true that the speeds most often used yield a capacity limit of around four, but I haven't seen any argument for why the commonly used speeds/spatial proximities/temporal frequency combination is more special than the other possibilities. I guess one could argue that researchers set those parameters to resemble an intuition for what real-world tasks are like, but even if they got that right, I'm not sure the same is true for VWM setups, or what that would imply for underlying ability structures. It seems to me one would have to do some kind of ideal observer (really, ideal thinker) model with the same assumptions that can model both common VWM and common MOT tasks, and show that the same level of ability in fundamental processes underlying each would yield the same capacity limit of four in both cases.

Thus, while many potential athlete users may imagine that a test of attention tests how long they can pay attention, this is not likely to be the reason for differences among people on MOT performance. 

## The decline of Pylyshyn's FINST theory

We've come a long way. One way to see that is

These findings rebut Pylyshyn's theory that tracking reflects preattentive indices [@schollWhatHaveWe2008]

"The assumption that spatial indexes are provided by VSTM is at odds with the models of multiple object tracking, which posit that no memory is needed to perform the task" Pylyshyn1989 , Yantis1992

"Our pupil data (see also Alnæs et al., 2014) indicate that both MIT and MOT are attention-demanding (thus ruling out preattentive models, such as FINST of Pylyshyn, 1989), " @oksama

"whereas at high speeds, only one target could be tracked. This is strong evidence against Pylyshyn’s (1989, 2006) account, which predicts that capacity should be constant."

Although CDA findings suggest there is something tracking number of objects rather than resources expended @drewVogel @balabanObjectRepresentationsVisual2016, I don't know that it supports a limit on this

But the CDA suggests there 

At the time of this writing, Pylyshyn's theory is the featured theory on the Wikipedia page for multiple object tracking, and it is frequently invoked in the scholarly literature as well.

Further undermines Pylyshyn's conception

Early work had concluded that MOT could not reflect serial position sampling @pylyshynTrackingMultipleIndependent1988; @yantisMultielementVisualTracking1992

It is well-known that a decrease with target load, linear or non-linear, can be explained by parallel models as well as serial models.

## Recommendations

Always use several targets, not just two or three, to dilute the influence of C=1 processes. And still evaluate whether such a process could be the only one contributing. 
The use of concurrent tasks (a "dual-task design") can also help. Perhaps the most powerful factor to exploit is hemifield specificity. This is sorely underused.


Always test for hemifield specificity. This tells us whether

The effect increases with retention interval, and may be a more cognitive mechanism, as it has been suggested that  Rep- resentational momentum occurs in memory for implied motion stimuli and  neither of which elicits pursuit eye movements.

Don't model random trajectory data, that probably doesn't constrain models enough. Show you can model both spatial crowding and temporal crowding  Another strategy is to model much larger sets of data, at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from at most two different MOT experiments.

Two strategies to improve the constraints on models present themselves. One is to fix the individual components of the models based on the results of experiments designed to isolate those component, such as the experiments by [@verstratenLimitsAttentiveTracking2000; @holcombeSplittingAttentionReduces2013; @roudaiaDifferentEffectsAging2017] for identifying temporal limits and that of @holcombeObjectTrackingAbsence2014 to identify the range of spatial crowding. Another strategy is to model much larger sets of data, at an individual trial level; previous efforts seem to have modelled data from at most two different MOT experiments.

Study change detection during motion.

Dual-task 

<!--
## Dual-task OUT OF SCOPE

Another experiment indicates that trying to remember object identities can actually interfere with the ability to track [@fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006]. This is consistent with the possibility that position tracking and object feature updating rely on distinct mental capacities. MOT interfered with VWM a lot although not as much as VWM interfered with VWM

" though both search and MOT can be highly atten- tionally demanding, they may do so via demands on partially independent attentional subsystems. In particular, visual search may interfere dramati- cally with scene encoding because both processes rely heavily on the same underlying ventral identification-based form of attention. In contrast, MOT fails to interfere with scene encoding more than central executive tasks because MOT relies primarily on a different underlying type of visual attention, one that is dorsal and individuation based. This distinction may also help to explain why MOT and search interfere with each other so little (Alvarez et al. 2005): They may both be highly attention-demanding, yet they may draw on fundamentally different forms of attention. Similarly, this may help to explain why observers are relatively poor at encoding surface features of objects in MOT—including those of tracked targets (see, e.g., Bahrami 2003; Ko and Seiffert 2006; Scholl, Pylyshyn, and Franconeri 1999). "

The dual-task literature is very large. Can't review it all here

Alvarez, G.A., et al., Are mutielement visual tracking and visual search mutually exclusive? Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2005. 31(4): p. 643-667.

There seems to be an especially close link between MOT and subitizing
@trickAgeDifferencesEnumerating2003 observed that even very slow motion reduced
enumeration speed for stimuli containing 6–9 items, while
the enumeration of 1–4 items was not affected when items
were in motion. Similarly, @alstonSubitizationAttentionalEngagement2004
presented static and moving items, finding that faster and
more accurate enumeration occurred in the subitizing range
given the presence of moving items.

psilocybin seems to impair MOT but not visual working memory [@carterUsingPsilocybinInvestigate2005] 

Subitizing no bilateral advantage on accuracy, but that could be due to very high accuracy - when looking at response time, an advantage is found, although not clear it's as large as that for MOT @railoBilateralTwoitemAdvantage2014

"The results indicated that the number of items participants could subitize decreased by one for each item they tracked." @chesneyEvidenceSharedMechanism2011

 "concurrent performance of a MOT task and a VWM task still instilled substantial and load-dependent dual-task costs. " @fougnieDistinctCapacityLimits2006

@allenMultipletargetTrackingRole2006

object tracking in people with Williams Syndrome remains at the level of 4‐year‐olds, whereas the ability to remember multiple locations of static objects develops further. @ohearnDevelopmentalProfilesMultiple2010 

@howardVisualSpatialAttention2020 "for a purely spatial task, perceptual attention (TRACKING?) and working memory appear to recruit separate core capacity-limited processes."

@souzaContributionsVisualCentral2017 argued that VWM and MOT use different attentional resources." "Distracting visual attention, but not central attention, impaired MOT performance"
