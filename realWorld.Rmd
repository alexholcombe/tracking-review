# Towards the real world

Some of the findings in multiple object tracking, and visual attention more generally, are useful for informing how non-scientists should think about real-world situations. A naive view of visual perception and attention is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene. Many sports coaches may unfortunately believe this, thinking that unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone in front of us on the basketball court, or the soccer field, is at all times. Similarly, during driving many people seem to assume that they are aware of all hazards in their visual field. The fact that this is not accurate has been incorporated into driver education [@fisherCanNoviceDrivers2006].

The limitations of drivers in apprehending upcoming hazards, and lack of awareness of other players in the visual field in sportspeople, are often described in classes as being related to change blindness, which no doubt they are, but the limitations on multiple object tracking almost certainly contribute to them. When an object is being actively attended, which in a moving scene means tracked, change blindness or lack of knowledge of the object's identity is somewhat less likely. This was supported in a study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014 involving a driving simulator, who found that changes were found more accurately and rapidly when the change was made to a target vehicle rather than a distractor vehicle. The poor maintenance of non-spatial featural information during tracking (described in chapter \@ref(identity)) also should inform our approach to real-world situations.

Few empirical studies, unfortunately, have made strong links between real-world situations nad laboratory MOT tasks, or its underlying abilities. @bowersCanWeImprove2013 found that laboratory MOT performance did not predict driving test performance as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment task, a trail-making task, or a subtest of a useful field-of-view task. The aforementioned driving simulator study by @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014 found that drivers were more accurate at localizing which of multiple lead vehicles braked if it was a tracking target, but there was no advantage in terms of braking response time. 

@mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 used a multiple object avoidance task where the user used a mouse to control one of the balls that they had to prevent from colliding with the other balls. The task is reminiscent of the old Asteroids game mentioned in the beginning of this book. @mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 found strong correlations with performance on a driving simulator and with years of driving experience. In an earlier paper, some of these authors found that the MOA correlated better with driving performance than conventional MOT [@mackenzieLinkAttentionalFunction2017]. 

In sports, some teams of researchers have frequently suggested that MOT performance predicts in-game performance in soccer and other sports, and further reported evidence that training on MOT tasks can enhance skill in sports. Unfortunately, the associated evidence is not strong [@vaterCriticalSystematicReview2021]. Given the poor record of computer-based training tasks (sometimes called "brain training") in improving skills in other real-world domains, one should remain skeptical that MOT training has benefits until rigorous evidence is provided [@simonsBraintrainingProgramsWork2016].
