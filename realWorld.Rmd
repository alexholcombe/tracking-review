# Real world

**Towards the real-world** and real-world tasks. A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone on the bacsketball court is at all times. Bringing together the factors described in previous sections, and bringing in new ones such as limits on feature binding, we will analyze some real-world tasks.

"further research is required to determine whether multiple-object tracking is actually used in day-to-day driving." @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014
 
 @mackenzieMultipleObjectAvoidance2021 used a multiple object avoidance task where the user used a mouse to control one of the balls that they had to prevent from colliding with the other balls. It's reminiscent of the old Asteroids video game that we opened this book with. Found decent correlations with performance on a driving simulator and with years of driving experience. In an earlier paper, some of these authors found that the MOA correlated better with driving performance than conventional MOT @mackenzieLinkAttentionalFunction2017 . @bowersCanWeImprove2013 found no correlation between MOT and  . there's one other paper.

@mangineVisualTrackingSpeed2014 Twelve professional basketball players were tested before the 2012â€“13 season. Visual tracking speed was obtained from 1 core session (20 trials) of the multiple object tracking test, whereas RT was measured by fixed- and variable-region choice reaction tests, using a light-based testing device. Performance in VTS and RT was compared with basketball-specific measures of performance (assists [AST]; turnovers [TO]; assist-to-turnover ratio [AST/TO]; steals [STL]) during the regular basketball season. All performance measures were reported per 100 minutes played. Performance differences between backcourt (guards; n = 5) and frontcourt (forward/centers; n = 7...
