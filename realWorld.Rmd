# Real world

**Towards the real-world** and real-world tasks. A naive view of visual perception is that we are simultaneously aware of the identities of all the objects in a scene, so unless a player actually disappears or hides behind something or someone, we should know where everyone on the bacsketball court is at all times. Bringing together the factors described in previous sections, and bringing in new ones such as limits on feature binding, we will analyze some real-world tasks.

"further research is required to determine whether multiple-object tracking is actually used in day-to-day driving." @lochnerMultipleobjectTrackingDriving2014
 
 Piers found negative evidence. there's one other paper.

@mangineVisualTrackingSpeed2014 Twelve professional basketball players were tested before the 2012â€“13 season. Visual tracking speed was obtained from 1 core session (20 trials) of the multiple object tracking test, whereas RT was measured by fixed- and variable-region choice reaction tests, using a light-based testing device. Performance in VTS and RT was compared with basketball-specific measures of performance (assists [AST]; turnovers [TO]; assist-to-turnover ratio [AST/TO]; steals [STL]) during the regular basketball season. All performance measures were reported per 100 minutes played. Performance differences between backcourt (guards; n = 5) and frontcourt (forward/centers; n = 7...
