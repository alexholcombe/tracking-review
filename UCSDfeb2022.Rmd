This will make the case for tracking being much more important than people realize.  but you can't even perceive spatial relationships.

At the same time, what little most psychology researchers think they know about object tracking is wrong.

# Individual differences

High split-half reliability (>0.8), unlike other cognitive tasks.
<!--Headed to Portland-->

Only a handful of proper individual-difference studies.

A large set of studies with "Neurotracker" and other products, looking at correlations and also training, almost all with shoddy research designs.

# Hemifield specificity

The most important discovery, yet sadly neglected and unexploited. Is this new tracking result about tracking or about limits on cognition?

The way to distinguish from C~1 processes.

# Predictive brain?

# Objects in motion

Motion silencing

# Serial or parallel?

Seems like limited-capacity parallel.

But conventional tests don't really probe that.

There's no work on hemifield specificity of sampling.
